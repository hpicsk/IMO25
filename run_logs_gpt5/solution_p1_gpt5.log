Every step in your solution must be logically sound and clearly explained. A correct final answer derived from flawed or incomplete reasoning is considered a failure.\n*   **Honesty About Completeness:** If you cannot find a complete solution, you must **not** guess or create a solution that appears correct but contains hidden flaws or justification gaps. Instead, you should present only significant partial results that you can rigorously prove. A partial result is considered significant if it represents a substantial advancement toward a full solution. Examples include:\n    *   Proving a key lemma.\n    *   Fully resolving one or more cases within a logically sound case-based proof.\n    *   Establishing a critical property of the mathematical objects in the problem.\n    *   For an optimization problem, proving an upper or lower bound without proving that this bound is achievable.\n*   **Use TeX for All Mathematics:** All mathematical variables, expressions, and relations must be enclosed in TeX delimiters (e.g., `Let $n$ be an integer.`).\n\n### Output Format ###\n\nYour response MUST be structured into the following sections, in this exact order.\n\n**1. Summary**\n\nProvide a concise overview of your findings. This section must contain two parts:\n\n*   **a. Verdict:** State clearly whether you have found a complete solution or a partial solution.\n    *   **For a complete solution:** State the final answer, e.g., \"I have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is...\"\n    *   **For a partial solution:** State the main rigorous conclusion(s) you were able to prove, e.g., \"I have not found a complete solution, but I have rigorously proven that...\"\n*   **b. Method Sketch:** Present a high-level, conceptual outline of your solution. This sketch should allow an expert to understand the logical flow of your argument without reading the full detail. It should include:\n    *   A narrative of your overall strategy.\n    *   The full and precise mathematical statements of any key lemmas or major intermediate results.\n    *   If applicable, describe any key constructions or case splits that form the backbone of your argument.\n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\nPresent the full, step-by-step mathematical proof. Each step must be logically justified and clearly explained. The level of detail should be sufficient for an expert to verify the correctness of your reasoning without needing to fill in any gaps. This section must contain ONLY the complete, rigorous proof, free of any internal commentary, alternative approaches, or failed attempts.\n\n### Self-Correction Instruction ###\n\nBefore finalizing your output, carefully review your \"Method Sketch\" and \"Detailed Solution\" to ensure they are clean, rigorous, and strictly adhere to all instructions provided above.

Verdict:\nI have not found a complete solution, but I have rigorously proven the following partial results.\n\n- For every integer n \u2265 3, there exist n distinct lines in the plane satisfying the covering condition with exactly k sunny lines for each k \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.\n- In particular, explicit constructions are provided for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\nLet S_n denote the set of integer points (a,b) with a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, and a + b \u2264 n + 1.\nA line is sunny if it is not parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or the line x + y = 0 (i.e., not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121).\n\nKey constructions (for any n \u2265 3):\n\n- k = 0:\n  Use the n vertical lines x = 1, 2, ..., n. These are all non-sunny and cover S_n because for each (a,b) \u2208 S_n, the vertical line x = a contains (a,b).\n\n- k = 1:\n  Use the n \u2212 1 vertical lines x = 1, 2, ..., n \u2212 1, and add one sunny line passing through (n,1). For example, the line through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3) has slope 2 and is sunny. This covers the last column (which consists of the single point (n,1)) and all other points are covered by the verticals.\n\n- k = 2:\n  Use the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, 2, ..., n \u2212 3, and one non-sunny diagonal line x + y = n + 1. These together cover all of S_n except exactly the two points (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 1). Add two sunny lines, e.g.,\n  \u2022 a line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (1,2), and\n  \u2022 a line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (1,3).\n  These two additional lines are sunny (their slopes are neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121) and complete the cover.\n\n- k = 3:\n  Use the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, 2, ..., n \u2212 3, and add the following three sunny lines:\n  \u2022 L1: the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), which has equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) (slope 1, sunny);\n  \u2022 L2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), which has slope \u22122 (sunny);\n  \u2022 L3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), which has slope \u22121/2 (sunny).\n  One checks that these three lines cover exactly the six points in the last three columns, while the n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all earlier columns.\n\nThe proofs below verify that in each case all required points are covered and the sunny/non-sunny counts are as claimed.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nFix n \u2265 3 and let S_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nCase k = 0.\nConsider the n vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n.\nEach point (a,b) \u2208 S_n lies on the line x = a, so S_n is covered. None of these lines is sunny (they are all vertical). The lines are distinct. Hence k = 0 is achievable.\n\nCase k = 1.\nConsider the n \u2212 1 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1,\nand the additional line L passing through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is\n(3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122,\nwhich is neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121; hence L is sunny.\n\nCoverage: The vertical lines cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 1. The only point of S_n with a = n is (n, 1), because a + b \u2264 n + 1 forces b = 1. This point lies on L by construction. Thus every point of S_n is covered. The total number of lines is (n \u2212 1) + 1 = n with exactly one sunny line. Hence k = 1 is achievable.\n\nCase k = 2.\nConsider the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3,\nand the non-sunny diagonal line\nx + y = n + 1.\nThese n \u2212 2 lines cover all points except exactly the two points (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 1):\n- For a \u2264 n \u2212 3, the verticals cover all points in those columns.\n- For a = n \u2212 2, the three points are (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3); among these, (n \u2212 2, 3) lies on the diagonal x + y = n + 1, while the other two do not lie on any of the chosen lines.\n- For a = n \u2212 1, the two points are (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2); among these, (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on the diagonal x + y = n + 1, while (n \u2212 1, 1) does not.\n- For a = n, the sole point (n,1) lies on x + y = n + 1.\n\nNow add two sunny lines:\n- L1 is the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (1,2). Its slope is (2 \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = 1/(3 \u2212 n). Since n \u2265 3, this slope is neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121. Thus L1 is sunny, and it covers (n \u2212 2, 1).\n- L2 is the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (1,3). Its slope is (3 \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(2 \u2212 n). Since n \u2265 3, this slope is neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121. Thus L2 is sunny, and it covers (n \u2212 1, 1).\n\nTherefore, the set of (n \u2212 3) vertical lines, the diagonal x + y = n + 1, and the two sunny lines L1, L2 covers all of S_n. The total number of lines is (n \u2212 3) + 1 + 2 = n, with exactly two sunny lines. Hence k = 2 is achievable.\n\nCase k = 3.\nConsider the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3.\nThey cover all columns with a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The remaining points lie in the last three columns a = n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1, n, namely:\n- a = n \u2212 2: (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3);\n- a = n \u2212 1: (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2);\n- a = n: (n, 1).\n\nAdd the following three sunny lines:\n\n- L1: the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2). Its equation is y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3). The slope is 1, which is sunny.\n\n- L2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3). Its slope is (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122, which is sunny.\n\n- L3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2). Its slope is (1 \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = (\u22121)/2 = \u22121/2, which is sunny.\n\nVerification of coverage of the last three columns:\n- Column a = n \u2212 2: (n \u2212 2, 1) lies on L1; (n \u2212 2, 2) lies on L3; (n \u2212 2, 3) lies on L2.\n- Column a = n \u2212 1: (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on L1; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L2.\n- Column a = n: (n, 1) lies on L3.\n\nThus every point in the last three columns is covered by L1, L2, L3, while all earlier columns are covered by the verticals. The lines are distinct, and exactly three are sunny. Hence k = 3 is achievable.\n\nThis completes the constructions for k \u2208 {0,1,2,3} for all n \u2265 3."

The only point of S_n with a = n is (n, 1), because a + b \u2264 n + 1 forces b = 1. This point lies on L by construction. Thus every point of S_n is covered. The total number of lines is (n \u2212 1) + 1 = n with exactly one sunny line. Hence k = 1 is achievable.\n\nCase k = 2.\nConsider the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3,\nand the non-sunny diagonal line\nx + y = n + 1.\nThese n \u2212 2 lines cover all points except exactly the two points (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 1):\n- For a \u2264 n \u2212 3, the verticals cover all points in those columns.\n- For a = n \u2212 2, the three points are (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3); among these, (n \u2212 2, 3) lies on the diagonal x + y = n + 1, while the other two do not lie on any of the chosen lines.\n- For a = n \u2212 1, the two points are (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2); among these, (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on the diagonal x + y = n + 1, while (n \u2212 1, 1) does not.\n- For a = n, the sole point (n,1) lies on x + y = n + 1.\n\nNow add two sunny lines:\n- L1 is the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (1,2). Its slope is (2 \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = 1/(3 \u2212 n). Since n \u2265 3, this slope is neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121. Thus L1 is sunny, and it covers (n \u2212 2, 1).\n- L2 is the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (1,3). Its slope is (3 \u2212 1)/(1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(2 \u2212 n). Since n \u2265 3, this slope is neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121.

The total number of lines is (n \u2212 3) + 1 + 2 = n, with exactly two sunny lines.

Its equation is y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3). The slope is 1, which is sunny.\n\n- L2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3). Its slope is (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122, which is sunny.\n\n- L3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2). Its slope is (1 \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = (\u22121)/2 = \u22121/2, which is sunny.\n\nVerification of coverage of the last three columns:\n- Column a = n \u2212 2: (n \u2212 2, 1) lies on L1; (n \u2212 2, 2) lies on L3; (n \u2212 2, 3) lies on L2.\n- Column a = n \u2212 1: (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on L1; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L2.\n- Column a = n: (n, 1) lies on L3.\n\nThus every point in the last three columns is covered by L1, L2, L3, while all earlier columns are covered by the verticals. The lines are distinct, and exactly three are sunny. Hence k = 3 is achievable.\n\nThis completes the constructions for k \u2208 {0,1,2,3} for all n \u2265 3."

I have rigorously proved the following:\n\n- Upper bound: For every integer n \u2265 3, any family of n distinct lines covering all integer points (a,b) with a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 has at most 3 sunny lines. Equivalently, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny.\n\n- Achievability: For every n \u2265 3, there exist n lines satisfying the covering condition with exactly k sunny lines for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\n- Correction of a previous error: The earlier construction claimed to achieve k = 2 for all n \u2265 3 was incorrect. In particular, the stated n \u2212 3 vertical lines together with the line x + y = n + 1 and two \u201csunny\u201d lines cannot cover the set S_n; there remain three points that cannot be covered by only two sunny lines, as any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line. I have not settled whether k = 2 is achievable or impossible in full generality.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\nLet S_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny if it is not parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or the line x + y = 0.\n\nKey lemma (boundary lemma):\n- Lemma. Let m \u2265 4. If m distinct lines cover all integer points on the boundary of S_m (hence all of S_m), then at least one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1 is among these lines.\n- Proof idea: The boundary of S_m has 3m \u2212 3 integer points. A line that is not one of the three boundary sides meets the boundary in at most two integer points. Hence without using at least one boundary side, m lines cover at most 2m boundary points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4.\n\nIterative peeling:\n- Starting from S_n, apply the boundary lemma to infer that among any covering by n lines there must be a boundary side. Remove that side and its covered points; the remainder is a translate of S_{n\u22121}. Repeat until reaching S_3. This shows that at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny; hence the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\n\nConstructions (achievability):\n- k = 0: Take the n vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n.\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 1 vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n \u2212 1 and one sunny line through (n,1) with slope neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121 (e.g., the line through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1,3) has slope \u22122).\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L1: through (n \u2212 2,1) and (n \u2212 1,2) (slope 1),\n  L2: through (n \u2212 1,1) and (n \u2212 2,3) (slope \u22122),\n  L3: through (n,1) and (n \u2212 2,2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These three lines cover the last three columns completely.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nFix an integer n \u2265 3 and define\nS_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe say a line is non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121 (i.e., parallel to the sides of the triangle S_n), and sunny otherwise.\n\nPart I. An upper bound: k \u2264 3.\n\nLemma (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Let L_1, \u2026, L_m be m distinct lines in the plane that together cover S_m. Then at least one of the three boundary sides\nx = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1\nis among the L_i.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m denote the set of boundary integer points of S_m. It is easy to count |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m. On the other hand, each of the three boundary sides contains exactly m integer points of B_m.\n\nIf none of L_1, \u2026, L_m equals one of the three boundary sides, then the total number of boundary points they can cover is at most 2m. But for m \u2265 4 we have 2m < 3m \u2212 3 = |B_m|, a contradiction. Hence at least one of the three boundary sides must belong to {L_1, \u2026, L_m}. This proves the lemma.\n\nProposition (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\n\nProof.\nWe proceed by induction on m, starting from m = n and reducing m by 1 at each step.\n\nStep m = n. By the boundary lemma, among the n covering lines there exists a side of S_n, i.e., one of the non-sunny lines x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = n + 1. Remove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\n\nStep m \u2192 m \u2212 1. Suppose after removing j boundary sides we are left with S_{n\u2212j} covered by the remaining n \u2212 j lines. If n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applied to S_{n\u2212j} forces another boundary side of S_{n\u2212j} to be among these lines. That side is again a non-sunny line (parallel to one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 0 in the original coordinates). Remove it and proceed.\n\nThis iteration runs as long as n \u2212 j \u2265 4, i.e., for j = 0,1,\u2026,n \u2212 4. Thus, we have removed at least n \u2212 3 boundary sides in total, which are all non-sunny lines. Therefore, among the original n lines, at least n \u2212 3 are non-sunny, so at most 3 are sunny. This proves the proposition.\n\nPart II. Constructions for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nWe now show that for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} there exists a set of n lines that covers S_n and has exactly k sunny lines.\n\nCase k = 0.\nTake the n vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n.\nFor every (a,b) \u2208 S_n we have (a,b) on the line x = a. All lines are non-sunny. Distinctness is clear.\n\nCase k = 1.\nTake the n \u2212 1 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1,\nand one extra line L through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is\n(3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122,\nhence L is sunny. The verticals cover all points in columns a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the only point with a = n is (n,1), which lies on L. Thus S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\nCase k = 3.\nTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3,\nand the three sunny lines:\n- L_1: the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), which has equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) and slope 1;\n- L_2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), which has slope (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122;\n- L_3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), which has slope (1 \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = (\u22121)/2 = \u22121/2.\n\nAll three slopes are distinct and not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}, so these lines are sunny and distinct.\n\nVerification of coverage. The n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 completely. The remaining points lie in the last three columns:\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 2: the points are (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3). Here, (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2208 L_1, (n \u2212 2, 2) \u2208 L_3, and (n \u2212 2, 3) \u2208 L_2.\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 1: the points are (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2). Here, (n \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) \u2208 L_1.\n\n- Column a = n: the only point is (n, 1), which lies on L_3.\n\nThus all points of S_n are covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nPart III. On k = 2.\n\nThe earlier proposed construction for k = 2 (n \u2212 3 verticals, the diagonal x + y = n + 1, and two sunny lines) was incorrect: after placing x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x + y = n + 1, the uncovered points among the last three columns are precisely\n(n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 1, 1),\nand any two of these three points lie on a non-sunny line (vertical, horizontal, or of slope \u22121). Hence they cannot be covered by only two sunny lines.\n\nI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\n\nConclusion.\n- Proven: In any covering by n lines, at most 3 lines are sunny (k \u2264 3). Constructions exist for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- Outstanding: The existence (or nonexistence) of a covering with exactly k = 2 sunny lines for general n \u2265 3."

    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response.

Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nFix an integer n \u2265 3 and define\nS_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe say a line is non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121 (i.e., parallel to the sides of the triangle S_n), and sunny otherwise.\n\nPart I. An upper bound: k \u2264 3.\n\nLemma (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Let L_1, \u2026, L_m be m distinct lines in the plane that together cover S_m. Then at least one of the three boundary sides\nx = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1\nis among the L_i.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m denote the set of boundary integer points of S_m. It is easy to count |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m. On the other hand, each of the three boundary sides contains exactly m integer points of B_m.\n\nIf none of L_1, \u2026, L_m equals one of the three boundary sides, then the total number of boundary points they can cover is at most 2m. But for m \u2265 4 we have 2m < 3m \u2212 3 = |B_m|, a contradiction. Hence at least one of the three boundary sides must belong to {L_1, \u2026, L_m}. This proves the lemma.\n\nProposition (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\n\nProof.\nWe proceed by induction on m, starting from m = n and reducing m by 1 at each step.\n\nStep m = n. By the boundary lemma, among the n covering lines there exists a side of S_n, i.e., one of the non-sunny lines x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = n + 1. Remove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\n\nStep m \u2192 m \u2212 1. Suppose after removing j boundary sides we are left with S_{n\u2212j} covered by the remaining n \u2212 j lines. If n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applied to S_{n\u2212j} forces another boundary side of S_{n\u2212j} to be among these lines. That side is again a non-sunny line (parallel to one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 0 in the original coordinates). Remove it and proceed.\n\nThis iteration runs as long as n \u2212 j \u2265 4, i.e., for j = 0,1,\u2026,n \u2212 4. Thus, we have removed at least n \u2212 3 boundary sides in total, which are all non-sunny lines. Therefore, among the original n lines, at least n \u2212 3 are non-sunny, so at most 3 are sunny. This proves the proposition.\n\nPart II. Constructions for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nWe now show that for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} there exists a set of n lines that covers S_n and has exactly k sunny lines.\n\nCase k = 0.\nTake the n vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n.\nFor every (a,b) \u2208 S_n we have (a,b) on the line x = a. All lines are non-sunny. Distinctness is clear.\n\nCase k = 1.\nTake the n \u2212 1 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1,\nand one extra line L through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is\n(3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122,\nhence L is sunny. The verticals cover all points in columns a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the only point with a = n is (n,1), which lies on L. Thus S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\nCase k = 3.\nTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3,\nand the three sunny lines:\n- L_1: the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), which has equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) and slope 1;\n- L_2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), which has slope (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122;\n- L_3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), which has slope (1 \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = (\u22121)/2 = \u22121/2.\n\nAll three slopes are distinct and not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}, so these lines are sunny and distinct.\n\nVerification of coverage. The n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 completely. The remaining points lie in the last three columns:\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 2: the points are (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3). Here, (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2208 L_1, (n \u2212 2, 2) \u2208 L_3, and (n \u2212 2, 3) \u2208 L_2.\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 1: the points are (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2). Here, (n \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) \u2208 L_1.\n\n- Column a = n: the only point is (n, 1), which lies on L_3.\n\nThus all points of S_n are covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nPart III. On k = 2.\n\nThe earlier proposed construction for k = 2 (n \u2212 3 verticals, the diagonal x + y = n + 1, and two sunny lines) was incorrect: after placing x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x + y = n + 1, the uncovered points among the last three columns are precisely\n(n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 1, 1),\nand any two of these three points lie on a non-sunny line (vertical, horizontal, or of slope \u22121). Hence they cannot be covered by only two sunny lines.\n\nI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\n\nConclusion.\n- Proven: In any covering by n lines, at most 3 lines are sunny (k \u2264 3). Constructions exist for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- Outstanding: The existence (or nonexistence) of a covering with exactly k = 2 sunny lines for general n \u2265 3.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\u201d\n  - Issue: The solution leaves the k = 2 case unresolved, so it does not determine all admissible k as required by the problem. Classification: Critical Error.\n- Location: \u201cA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m.\u201d\n  - Issue: Minor imprecision: the line intersects the triangle (closed region) in a segment; its intersection with the boundary is at most two points (possibly one if passing through a vertex). The intended bound \u201cat most two boundary lattice points per line\u201d is correct, but the wording is sloppy. Classification: Justification Gap.\n- Location: \u201cRemove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\u201d\n  - Issue: Only one of the three cases is explicitly explained; the other two (removing x = 1 or x + y = m + 1) are left implicit. The claim is correct, but the explanation is not fully spelled out. Classification: Justification Gap.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Setup and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cFix an integer n \u2265 3 and define S_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\u201d\n  - Check: This exactly encodes the set of integer points the problem requires to be covered. Correct.\n- Quote: \u201cWe say a line is non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121 (i.e., parallel to the sides of the triangle S_n), and sunny otherwise.\u201d\n  - Check: This matches the problem\u2019s definition (not parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x + y = 0). Correct.\n\n2) Part I: Boundary lemma\n- Quote: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Let L_1, \u2026, L_m be m distinct lines in the plane that together cover S_m. Then at least one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1 is among the L_i.\u201d\n  - This is the statement to be proved.\n\n- Quote: \u201cLet B_m denote the set of boundary integer points of S_m. It is easy to count |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n  - Check: Points on x = 1: m points (1,1) to (1,m); on y = 1: m points (1,1) to (m,1); on x + y = m + 1: m points (1,m) to (m,1). Three corner points are double-counted, so total = 3m \u2212 3. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m.\u201d\n  - Assessment: The intended argument is that a line not coinciding with a side can meet the (piecewise linear) boundary in at most two points (possibly one if passing through a vertex). Therefore, it can contain at most two boundary lattice points. The phrase \u201cintersects the triangular boundary in a segment\u201d is imprecise (the intersection with the triangle is a segment; with the boundary it is a set of \u2264 2 points). Nonetheless, the conclusion \u201c\u2264 2 boundary lattice points per line\u201d is correct. Justification Gap noted, but we accept the conclusion for the sake of argument.\n\n- Quote: \u201cIf none of L_1, \u2026, L_m equals one of the three boundary sides, then the total number of boundary points they can cover is at most 2m. But for m \u2265 4 we have 2m < 3m \u2212 3 = |B_m|, a contradiction.\u201d\n  - Check: Since each line contributes at most two distinct boundary lattice points, the union covers \u2264 2m such points; but |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3 > 2m for m \u2265 4, so covering all boundary points is impossible under the assumption. Correct.\n\n- Conclusion: The lemma is valid for m \u2265 4.\n\n3) Part I: Proposition (peeling) and proof (k \u2264 3)\n- Quote: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\u201d\n  - This is the claim.\n\n- Quote: \u201cStep m = n. By the boundary lemma, among the n covering lines there exists a side of S_n, i.e., one of the non-sunny lines x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = n + 1. Remove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\u201d\n  - Check: For n \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applies and guarantees one of those three sides among the lines. Removing all points of S_n lying on that side yields:\n    - If y = 1 is removed: remaining set corresponds to {a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 n + 1}, which bijects to S_{n\u22121} via (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n    - If x = 1 is removed: similar bijection to S_{n\u22121} via (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n    - If x + y = n + 1 is removed: remaining set is {a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n}, which is exactly S_{n\u22121}.\n    - Minor Justification Gap: only one case is explicitly shown, but all are straightforward. The remaining n \u2212 1 lines still cover the remaining points since none of those points lie on the removed line. Correct.\n\n  - Note on n = 3: The boundary lemma is stated for m \u2265 4, so this peeling step is intended to start only when the current size parameter m \u2265 4. The author later clarifies the iteration runs while n \u2212 j \u2265 4. For n = 3, the trivial bound k \u2264 3 is satisfied anyway. No logical issue arises.\n\n- Quote: \u201cStep m \u2192 m \u2212 1. Suppose after removing j boundary sides we are left with S_{n\u2212j} covered by the remaining n \u2212 j lines. If n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applied to S_{n\u2212j} forces another boundary side of S_{n\u2212j} to be among these lines. That side is again a non-sunny line (parallel to one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 0 in the original coordinates). Remove it and proceed.\u201d\n  - Check: Given coverage of S_{n\u2212j} by n \u2212 j lines with n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applies to this instance, ensuring one of x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = (n \u2212 j) + 1 is among the lines; each is non-sunny. Removing it reduces both the point set and the number of lines by 1, preserving coverage. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cThis iteration runs as long as n \u2212 j \u2265 4, i.e., for j = 0,1,\u2026,n \u2212 4. Thus, we have removed at least n \u2212 3 boundary sides in total, which are all non-sunny lines.\u201d\n  - Check: The number of steps equals the number of integers j with 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 4, namely n \u2212 3 steps (for n \u2265 4). For n = 3, zero steps, consistent with \u201cat least n \u2212 3.\u201d Each removed line is non-sunny. Correct.\n\n- Conclusion: At least n \u2212 3 lines among the original n are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. The argument is sound.\n\n4) Part II: Constructions\n\n- Case k = 0\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n. For every (a,b) \u2208 S_n we have (a,b) on the line x = a. All lines are non-sunny. Distinctness is clear.\u201d\n  - Check: For a,b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 implies 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n; hence x = a covers (a,b). Vertical lines are non-sunny and distinct. Correct.\n\n- Case k = 1\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 1 vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1, and one extra line L through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = \u22122, hence L is sunny.\u201d\n  - Check: Slope \u22122 is not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}; so L is sunny. Distinctness from verticals is clear. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe verticals cover all points in columns a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the only point with a = n is (n,1), which lies on L. Thus S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\u201d\n  - Check: For a = n, b must be 1; the point (n,1) lies on L by construction. Exactly one sunny line (L). Correct.\n\n- Case k = 3\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3, and the three sunny lines:\n    - L_1: \u2026 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) (slope 1);\n    - L_2: \u2026 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), slope \u22122;\n    - L_3: \u2026 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), slope \u22121/2.\u201d\n  - Check: Slopes 1, \u22122, \u22121/2 are all distinct and not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}, so all three are sunny and the lines are distinct. Correct.\n\n  - Quote: \u201cVerification of coverage. The n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 completely. The remaining points lie in the last three columns: \u2026\u201d\n  - Check: For a = n \u2212 2: b = 1, 2, 3. Points are assigned as follows:\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2208 L_1 (y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) gives y = 1 at x = n \u2212 2); correct.\n    - (n \u2212 2, 2) \u2208 L_3 by definition of L_3; correct.\n    - (n \u2212 2, 3) \u2208 L_2 by definition of L_2; correct.\n    For a = n \u2212 1: b = 1, 2.\n    - (n \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 L_2 by definition; correct.\n    - (n \u2212 1, 2) \u2208 L_1 (y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) gives y = 2 at x = n \u2212 1); correct.\n    For a = n: b = 1:\n    - (n, 1) \u2208 L_3 by definition; correct.\n  - Conclusion: All points in S_n are covered; exactly three lines are sunny. Correct.\n\n5) Part III: On k = 2\n- Quote: \u201cafter placing x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x + y = n + 1, the uncovered points among the last three columns are precisely (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 1, 1)\u201d\n  - Check: The verticals cover columns up to n \u2212 3; the diagonal x + y = n + 1 covers (n \u2212 2, 3), (n \u2212 1, 2), and (n, 1). Thus the uncovered points listed are correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cany two of these three points lie on a non-sunny line (vertical, horizontal, or of slope \u22121). Hence they cannot be covered by only two sunny lines.\u201d\n  - Check: Pairs:\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2): vertical x = n \u2212 2 (non-sunny).\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 1): horizontal y = 1 (non-sunny).\n    - (n \u2212 2, 2) and (n \u2212 1, 1): line x + y = n (slope \u22121, non-sunny).\n    Since the unique line through any pair is non-sunny, no sunny line can pass through two of these points, so two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points. The proposed construction therefore fails. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\u201d\n  - Assessment: This leaves the problem unresolved for k = 2. The original problem asks to determine all admissible k; hence the solution is incomplete. This is a Critical Error with respect to the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n6) Conclusion section\n- Quote: \u201cProven: \u2026 k \u2264 3. Constructions exist for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}. Outstanding: \u2026 k = 2 \u2026\u201d\n  - Assessment: The established results k \u2264 3 and constructions for k \u2208 {0,1,3} are correct. However, the solution fails to determine whether k = 2 is achievable, so it does not solve the problem as stated. Critical Error confirmed."

"Summary\n\nFinal Verdict: The solution is incomplete: it does not determine whether k = 2 is possible, so it fails to fully answer the problem.\n\nList of Findings:\n- Location: \u201cI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\u201d\n  - Issue: The solution leaves the k = 2 case unresolved, so it does not determine all admissible k as required by the problem. Classification: Critical Error.\n- Location: \u201cA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m.\u201d\n  - Issue: Minor imprecision: the line intersects the triangle (closed region) in a segment; its intersection with the boundary is at most two points (possibly one if passing through a vertex). The intended bound \u201cat most two boundary lattice points per line\u201d is correct, but the wording is sloppy. Classification: Justification Gap.\n- Location: \u201cRemove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\u201d\n  - Issue: Only one of the three cases is explicitly explained; the other two (removing x = 1 or x + y = m + 1) are left implicit. The claim is correct, but the explanation is not fully spelled out. Classification: Justification Gap.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Setup and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cFix an integer n \u2265 3 and define S_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\u201d\n  - Check: This exactly encodes the set of integer points the problem requires to be covered. Correct.\n- Quote: \u201cWe say a line is non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121 (i.e., parallel to the sides of the triangle S_n), and sunny otherwise.\u201d\n  - Check: This matches the problem\u2019s definition (not parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x + y = 0). Correct.\n\n2) Part I: Boundary lemma\n- Quote: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Let L_1, \u2026, L_m be m distinct lines in the plane that together cover S_m. Then at least one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1 is among the L_i.\u201d\n  - This is the statement to be proved.\n\n- Quote: \u201cLet B_m denote the set of boundary integer points of S_m. It is easy to count |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n  - Check: Points on x = 1: m points (1,1) to (1,m); on y = 1: m points (1,1) to (m,1); on x + y = m + 1: m points (1,m) to (m,1). Three corner points are double-counted, so total = 3m \u2212 3. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m.\u201d\n  - Assessment: The intended argument is that a line not coinciding with a side can meet the (piecewise linear) boundary in at most two points (possibly one if passing through a vertex). Therefore, it can contain at most two boundary lattice points. The phrase \u201cintersects the triangular boundary in a segment\u201d is imprecise (the intersection with the triangle is a segment; with the boundary it is a set of \u2264 2 points). Nonetheless, the conclusion \u201c\u2264 2 boundary lattice points per line\u201d is correct. Justification Gap noted, but we accept the conclusion for the sake of argument.\n\n- Quote: \u201cIf none of L_1, \u2026, L_m equals one of the three boundary sides, then the total number of boundary points they can cover is at most 2m. But for m \u2265 4 we have 2m < 3m \u2212 3 = |B_m|, a contradiction.\u201d\n  - Check: Since each line contributes at most two distinct boundary lattice points, the union covers \u2264 2m such points; but |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3 > 2m for m \u2265 4, so covering all boundary points is impossible under the assumption. Correct.\n\n- Conclusion: The lemma is valid for m \u2265 4.\n\n3) Part I: Proposition (peeling) and proof (k \u2264 3)\n- Quote: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\u201d\n  - This is the claim.\n\n- Quote: \u201cStep m = n. By the boundary lemma, among the n covering lines there exists a side of S_n, i.e., one of the non-sunny lines x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = n + 1. Remove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\u201d\n  - Check: For n \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applies and guarantees one of those three sides among the lines. Removing all points of S_n lying on that side yields:\n    - If y = 1 is removed: remaining set corresponds to {a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 n + 1}, which bijects to S_{n\u22121} via (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n    - If x = 1 is removed: similar bijection to S_{n\u22121} via (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n    - If x + y = n + 1 is removed: remaining set is {a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n}, which is exactly S_{n\u22121}.\n    - Minor Justification Gap: only one case is explicitly shown, but all are straightforward. The remaining n \u2212 1 lines still cover the remaining points since none of those points lie on the removed line. Correct.\n\n  - Note on n = 3: The boundary lemma is stated for m \u2265 4, so this peeling step is intended to start only when the current size parameter m \u2265 4. The author later clarifies the iteration runs while n \u2212 j \u2265 4. For n = 3, the trivial bound k \u2264 3 is satisfied anyway. No logical issue arises.\n\n- Quote: \u201cStep m \u2192 m \u2212 1. Suppose after removing j boundary sides we are left with S_{n\u2212j} covered by the remaining n \u2212 j lines. If n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applied to S_{n\u2212j} forces another boundary side of S_{n\u2212j} to be among these lines. That side is again a non-sunny line (parallel to one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 0 in the original coordinates). Remove it and proceed.\u201d\n  - Check: Given coverage of S_{n\u2212j} by n \u2212 j lines with n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applies to this instance, ensuring one of x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = (n \u2212 j) + 1 is among the lines; each is non-sunny. Removing it reduces both the point set and the number of lines by 1, preserving coverage. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cThis iteration runs as long as n \u2212 j \u2265 4, i.e., for j = 0,1,\u2026,n \u2212 4. Thus, we have removed at least n \u2212 3 boundary sides in total, which are all non-sunny lines.\u201d\n  - Check: The number of steps equals the number of integers j with 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 4, namely n \u2212 3 steps (for n \u2265 4). For n = 3, zero steps, consistent with \u201cat least n \u2212 3.\u201d Each removed line is non-sunny. Correct.\n\n- Conclusion: At least n \u2212 3 lines among the original n are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. The argument is sound.\n\n4) Part II: Constructions\n\n- Case k = 0\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n. For every (a,b) \u2208 S_n we have (a,b) on the line x = a. All lines are non-sunny. Distinctness is clear.\u201d\n  - Check: For a,b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 implies 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n; hence x = a covers (a,b). Vertical lines are non-sunny and distinct. Correct.\n\n- Case k = 1\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 1 vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1, and one extra line L through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = \u22122, hence L is sunny.\u201d\n  - Check: Slope \u22122 is not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}; so L is sunny. Distinctness from verticals is clear. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe verticals cover all points in columns a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the only point with a = n is (n,1), which lies on L. Thus S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\u201d\n  - Check: For a = n, b must be 1; the point (n,1) lies on L by construction. Exactly one sunny line (L). Correct.\n\n- Case k = 3\n  - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3, and the three sunny lines:\n    - L_1: \u2026 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) (slope 1);\n    - L_2: \u2026 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), slope \u22122;\n    - L_3: \u2026 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), slope \u22121/2.\u201d\n  - Check: Slopes 1, \u22122, \u22121/2 are all distinct and not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}, so all three are sunny and the lines are distinct. Correct.\n\n  - Quote: \u201cVerification of coverage. The n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 completely. The remaining points lie in the last three columns: \u2026\u201d\n  - Check: For a = n \u2212 2: b = 1, 2, 3. Points are assigned as follows:\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2208 L_1 (y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) gives y = 1 at x = n \u2212 2); correct.\n    - (n \u2212 2, 2) \u2208 L_3 by definition of L_3; correct.\n    - (n \u2212 2, 3) \u2208 L_2 by definition of L_2; correct.\n    For a = n \u2212 1: b = 1, 2.\n    - (n \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 L_2 by definition; correct.\n    - (n \u2212 1, 2) \u2208 L_1 (y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) gives y = 2 at x = n \u2212 1); correct.\n    For a = n: b = 1:\n    - (n, 1) \u2208 L_3 by definition; correct.\n  - Conclusion: All points in S_n are covered; exactly three lines are sunny. Correct.\n\n5) Part III: On k = 2\n- Quote: \u201cafter placing x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x + y = n + 1, the uncovered points among the last three columns are precisely (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 1, 1)\u201d\n  - Check: The verticals cover columns up to n \u2212 3; the diagonal x + y = n + 1 covers (n \u2212 2, 3), (n \u2212 1, 2), and (n, 1). Thus the uncovered points listed are correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cany two of these three points lie on a non-sunny line (vertical, horizontal, or of slope \u22121). Hence they cannot be covered by only two sunny lines.\u201d\n  - Check: Pairs:\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2): vertical x = n \u2212 2 (non-sunny).\n    - (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 1): horizontal y = 1 (non-sunny).\n    - (n \u2212 2, 2) and (n \u2212 1, 1): line x + y = n (slope \u22121, non-sunny).\n    Since the unique line through any pair is non-sunny, no sunny line can pass through two of these points, so two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points. The proposed construction therefore fails. Correct.\n\n- Quote: \u201cI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\u201d\n  - Assessment: This leaves the problem unresolved for k = 2. The original problem asks to determine all admissible k; hence the solution is incomplete. This is a Critical Error with respect to the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n6) Conclusion section\n- Quote: \u201cProven: \u2026 k \u2264 3. Constructions exist for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}. Outstanding: \u2026 k = 2 \u2026\u201d\n  - Assessment: The established results k \u2264 3 and constructions for k \u2208 {0,1,3} are correct. However, the solution fails to determine whether k = 2 is achievable, so it does not solve the problem as stated. Critical Error confirmed."

Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\nAssistant: 1. Summary\n\na. Verdict:\nI have not found a complete solution. I have rigorously proved the following:\n\n- Upper bound: For every integer n \u2265 3, any family of n distinct lines covering all integer points (a,b) with a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 has at most 3 sunny lines. Equivalently, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny.\n\n- Achievability: For every n \u2265 3, there exist n lines satisfying the covering condition with exactly k sunny lines for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\n- Correction of a previous error: The earlier construction claimed to achieve k = 2 for all n \u2265 3 was incorrect. In particular, the stated n \u2212 3 vertical lines together with the line x + y = n + 1 and two \u201csunny\u201d lines cannot cover the set S_n; there remain three points that cannot be covered by only two sunny lines, as any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line. I have not settled whether k = 2 is achievable or impossible in full generality.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\nLet S_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny if it is not parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or the line x + y = 0.\n\nKey lemma (boundary lemma):\n- Lemma. Let m \u2265 4. If m distinct lines cover all integer points on the boundary of S_m (hence all of S_m), then at least one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1 is among these lines.\n- Proof idea: The boundary of S_m has 3m \u2212 3 integer points. A line that is not one of the three boundary sides meets the boundary in at most two integer points. Hence without using at least one boundary side, m lines cover at most 2m boundary points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4.\n\nIterative peeling:\n- Starting from S_n, apply the boundary lemma to infer that among any covering by n lines there must be a boundary side. Remove that side and its covered points; the remainder is a translate of S_{n\u22121}. Repeat until reaching S_3. This shows that at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny; hence the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\n\nConstructions (achievability):\n- k = 0: Take the n vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n.\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 1 vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n \u2212 1 and one sunny line through (n,1) with slope neither 0, \u221e, nor \u22121 (e.g., the line through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1,3) has slope \u22122).\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1,2,\u2026,n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L1: through (n \u2212 2,1) and (n \u2212 1,2) (slope 1),\n  L2: through (n \u2212 1,1) and (n \u2212 2,3) (slope \u22122),\n  L3: through (n,1) and (n \u2212 2,2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These three lines cover the last three columns completely.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nFix an integer n \u2265 3 and define\nS_n := { (a,b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe say a line is non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121 (i.e., parallel to the sides of the triangle S_n), and sunny otherwise.\n\nPart I. An upper bound: k \u2264 3.\n\nLemma (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Let L_1, \u2026, L_m be m distinct lines in the plane that together cover S_m. Then at least one of the three boundary sides\nx = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1\nis among the L_i.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m denote the set of boundary integer points of S_m. It is easy to count |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not one of the three boundary sides intersects the triangular boundary in a segment whose endpoints lie on two sides. In particular, it contains at most two integer points from B_m. On the other hand, each of the three boundary sides contains exactly m integer points of B_m.\n\nIf none of L_1, \u2026, L_m equals one of the three boundary sides, then the total number of boundary points they can cover is at most 2m. But for m \u2265 4 we have 2m < 3m \u2212 3 = |B_m|, a contradiction. Hence at least one of the three boundary sides must belong to {L_1, \u2026, L_m}. This proves the lemma.\n\nProposition (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3.\n\nProof.\nWe proceed by induction on m, starting from m = n and reducing m by 1 at each step.\n\nStep m = n. By the boundary lemma, among the n covering lines there exists a side of S_n, i.e., one of the non-sunny lines x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = n + 1. Remove that line and all points it covers. The remaining point set is precisely a translate of S_{n\u22121} (e.g., removing y = 1 corresponds to the map (a,b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1)).\n\nStep m \u2192 m \u2212 1. Suppose after removing j boundary sides we are left with S_{n\u2212j} covered by the remaining n \u2212 j lines. If n \u2212 j \u2265 4, the boundary lemma applied to S_{n\u2212j} forces another boundary side of S_{n\u2212j} to be among these lines. That side is again a non-sunny line (parallel to one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 0 in the original coordinates). Remove it and proceed.\n\nThis iteration runs as long as n \u2212 j \u2265 4, i.e., for j = 0,1,\u2026,n \u2212 4. Thus, we have removed at least n \u2212 3 boundary sides in total, which are all non-sunny lines. Therefore, among the original n lines, at least n \u2212 3 are non-sunny, so at most 3 are sunny. This proves the proposition.\n\nPart II. Constructions for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nWe now show that for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} there exists a set of n lines that covers S_n and has exactly k sunny lines.\n\nCase k = 0.\nTake the n vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n.\nFor every (a,b) \u2208 S_n we have (a,b) on the line x = a. All lines are non-sunny. Distinctness is clear.\n\nCase k = 1.\nTake the n \u2212 1 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 1,\nand one extra line L through (n,1) and (n \u2212 1, 3). The slope of L is\n(3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 1) \u2212 n) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122,\nhence L is sunny. The verticals cover all points in columns a \u2264 n \u2212 1, and the only point with a = n is (n,1), which lies on L. Thus S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\nCase k = 3.\nTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines\nx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3,\nand the three sunny lines:\n- L_1: the line through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), which has equation y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) and slope 1;\n- L_2: the line through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), which has slope (3 \u2212 1)/((n \u2212 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)) = 2/(\u22121) = \u22122;\n- L_3: the line through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2), which has slope (1 \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 (n \u2212 2)) = (\u22121)/2 = \u22121/2.\n\nAll three slopes are distinct and not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}, so these lines are sunny and distinct.\n\nVerification of coverage. The n \u2212 3 vertical lines cover all columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 completely. The remaining points lie in the last three columns:\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 2: the points are (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3). Here, (n \u2212 2, 1) \u2208 L_1, (n \u2212 2, 2) \u2208 L_3, and (n \u2212 2, 3) \u2208 L_2.\n\n- Column a = n \u2212 1: the points are (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2). Here, (n \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) \u2208 L_1.\n\n- Column a = n: the only point is (n, 1), which lies on L_3.\n\nThus all points of S_n are covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nPart III. On k = 2.\n\nThe earlier proposed construction for k = 2 (n \u2212 3 verticals, the diagonal x + y = n + 1, and two sunny lines) was incorrect: after placing x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x + y = n + 1, the uncovered points among the last three columns are precisely\n(n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 1, 1),\nand any two of these three points lie on a non-sunny line (vertical, horizontal, or of slope \u22121). Hence they cannot be covered by only two sunny lines.\n\nI do not have, at present, a complete proof that k = 2 is impossible for all n, nor a correct construction that achieves k = 2. Establishing the status of k = 2 remains open in this write-up.\n\nConclusion.\n- Proven: In any covering by n lines, at most 3 lines are sunny (k \u2264 3). Constructions exist for k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- Outstanding: The existence (or nonexistence) of a covering with exactly k = 2 sunny lines for general n \u2265 3.\n\nUser: \nBelow is the bug report.

The intended bound \u201cat most two boundary lattice points per line\u201d is correct, but the wording is sloppy. Classification: Justification Gap.\n- Location: \u201cRemove that line and all points it covers.

In particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny if and only if it is not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121 (equivalently, not parallel to any of the three sides of the triangular lattice region S_n).\n\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of these lines is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n  Proof idea: The set of boundary lattice points of S_m has cardinality 3m \u2212 3. Any line that is not one of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary in at most two points; hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. Therefore m such lines cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\n\n- Peeling (iterative reduction): Starting from S_n and any covering by n distinct lines, apply the boundary lemma to remove one side of S_n (which is a non-sunny line) together with the points it covers. The uncovered set is a smaller lattice triangle (precisely S_{n\u22121} up to translation). Repeat while the current size m \u2265 4. After n \u2212 3 steps, exactly three original lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines were non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. Moreover, the number of sunny lines in the original family equals the number of sunny lines among these final three lines that cover S_3.\n\n- Classification for S_3:\n  Let P := S_3 = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)}. A direct check shows that the only sunny lines through two points of P are exactly the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n  {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n  Consequently, two sunny lines can cover at most four points of P, leaving the remaining two as one of these three \u201csunny pairs,\u201d which are not collinear on any non-sunny line. Hence S_3 cannot be covered by three lines with exactly two sunny lines. On the other hand:\n  - 0 sunny: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n  - 1 sunny: x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) cover P.\n  - 3 sunny: the three pair-lines above cover P.\n\n- Lifting to general n:\n  To realize k \u2208 {0,1,3} for S_n, take the above three-line configurations on the \u201clast three columns\u201d and add n \u2212 3 boundary sides (e.g., the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3). The covering property holds, the total number of lines is n, and the number of sunny lines is exactly k. Since k = 2 is impossible already for S_3, it is impossible for S_n.\n\nKey lemmas/results used:\n- Boundary lemma: In any cover of S_m by m lines with m \u2265 4, one line is a boundary side.\n- Reduction lemma: Removing a boundary side of S_m leaves a set affinely congruent (by a translation) to S_{m\u22121}.\n- S_3 classification: Three lines cover S_3 with exactly t sunny lines if and only if t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 and S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe call a line non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or has slope \u22121, and sunny otherwise.\n\nStep 1. Boundary lemma.\n\nLemma 1 (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover all points of S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of S_m. The three sides x = 1, y = 1, and x + y = m + 1 contain m, m, and m lattice points, respectively, and the three vertices are counted twice in this triple count. Therefore\n|B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not equal to any of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary of S_m in at most two points. Hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. If none of the lines L_i is a boundary side, then together they cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is strictly less than 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4. This contradicts the fact that all points of B_m must be covered. Therefore at least one L_i is a boundary side. This proves the lemma.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3.\n\nProposition 2 (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as in the boundary lemma, the remaining three lines of the original family cover S_3.\n\nProof.\nWe perform an iterative removal. Start with m := n and the set S_m = S_n.\n\n- By Lemma 1 (since m \u2265 4 at the beginning), among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\n\n- The remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}. More precisely:\n  \u2022 If we removed y = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n  \u2022 If we removed x = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n  \u2022 If we removed x + y = m + 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m}, which equals S_{m\u22121}.\n\nIn all three cases, the removed line is non-sunny, and the uncovered set is (up to translation) S_{m\u22121}. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and repeat.\n\nThis process can be iterated while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family is exactly the number of sunny lines among the remaining three lines that cover S_3. This proves the proposition.\n\nStep 3. Classification of three-line covers of S_3.\n\nLet P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }. We determine the possible numbers t of sunny lines among three distinct lines that cover P.\n\nLemma 3 (sunny pair structure in S_3).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line (i.e., a line not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121) are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n\nProof.\nCompute the slopes for all 15 pairs. A direct check yields:\n- Horizontal (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the x-coordinate at fixed y (e.g., (1,1)-(2,1), (1,1)-(3,1), (2,1)-(3,1), (1,2)-(2,2)).\n- Vertical (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the y-coordinate at fixed x (e.g., (1,1)-(1,2), (1,1)-(1,3), (1,2)-(1,3), (2,1)-(2,2)).\n- Anti-diagonal (slope \u22121, non-sunny): (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(2,2), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,2)-(3,1).\n- Sunny lines (neither horizontal, vertical, nor slope \u22121): exactly\n  (1,1)-(2,2) with slope 1,\n  (1,2)-(3,1) with slope \u22121/2,\n  (1,3)-(2,1) with slope \u22122.\nNo other pair has a sunny slope. The three listed pairs are disjoint, as claimed.\n\nCorollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no covering of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nLet the three lines be L_1, L_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L_1 and L_2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L_1 \u222a L_2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line (it is collinear only on its own sunny line), so N cannot cover both of them. Hence a cover with exactly two sunny lines is impossible.\n\nProposition 5 (achievability on S_3).\nThree-line covers of P exist with exactly t sunny lines for t = 0, 1, 3:\n- t = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n- t = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\n- t = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\n\nCombining Corollary 4 and Proposition 5, the possible values are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion for general n.\n\nBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny). Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t of sunny lines among the final three lines covering S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.

"1. Summary\n\na. Verdict:\nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is: for every integer n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}. In particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny if and only if it is not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121 (equivalently, not parallel to any of the three sides of the triangular lattice region S_n).\n\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of these lines is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n  Proof idea: The set of boundary lattice points of S_m has cardinality 3m \u2212 3. Any line that is not one of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary in at most two points; hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. Therefore m such lines cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\n\n- Peeling (iterative reduction): Starting from S_n and any covering by n distinct lines, apply the boundary lemma to remove one side of S_n (which is a non-sunny line) together with the points it covers. The uncovered set is a smaller lattice triangle (precisely S_{n\u22121} up to translation). Repeat while the current size m \u2265 4. After n \u2212 3 steps, exactly three original lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines were non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. Moreover, the number of sunny lines in the original family equals the number of sunny lines among these final three lines that cover S_3.\n\n- Classification for S_3:\n  Let P := S_3 = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)}. A direct check shows that the only sunny lines through two points of P are exactly the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n  {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n  Consequently, two sunny lines can cover at most four points of P, leaving the remaining two as one of these three \u201csunny pairs,\u201d which are not collinear on any non-sunny line. Hence S_3 cannot be covered by three lines with exactly two sunny lines. On the other hand:\n  - 0 sunny: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n  - 1 sunny: x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) cover P.\n  - 3 sunny: the three pair-lines above cover P.\n\n- Lifting to general n:\n  To realize k \u2208 {0,1,3} for S_n, take the above three-line configurations on the \u201clast three columns\u201d and add n \u2212 3 boundary sides (e.g., the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3). The covering property holds, the total number of lines is n, and the number of sunny lines is exactly k. Since k = 2 is impossible already for S_3, it is impossible for S_n.\n\nKey lemmas/results used:\n- Boundary lemma: In any cover of S_m by m lines with m \u2265 4, one line is a boundary side.\n- Reduction lemma: Removing a boundary side of S_m leaves a set affinely congruent (by a translation) to S_{m\u22121}.\n- S_3 classification: Three lines cover S_3 with exactly t sunny lines if and only if t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 and S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe call a line non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or has slope \u22121, and sunny otherwise.\n\nStep 1. Boundary lemma.\n\nLemma 1 (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover all points of S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of S_m. The three sides x = 1, y = 1, and x + y = m + 1 contain m, m, and m lattice points, respectively, and the three vertices are counted twice in this triple count. Therefore\n|B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not equal to any of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary of S_m in at most two points. Hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. If none of the lines L_i is a boundary side, then together they cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is strictly less than 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4. This contradicts the fact that all points of B_m must be covered. Therefore at least one L_i is a boundary side. This proves the lemma.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3.\n\nProposition 2 (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as in the boundary lemma, the remaining three lines of the original family cover S_3.\n\nProof.\nWe perform an iterative removal. Start with m := n and the set S_m = S_n.\n\n- By Lemma 1 (since m \u2265 4 at the beginning), among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\n\n- The remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}. More precisely:\n  \u2022 If we removed y = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n  \u2022 If we removed x = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n  \u2022 If we removed x + y = m + 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m}, which equals S_{m\u22121}.\n\nIn all three cases, the removed line is non-sunny, and the uncovered set is (up to translation) S_{m\u22121}. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and repeat.\n\nThis process can be iterated while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family is exactly the number of sunny lines among the remaining three lines that cover S_3. This proves the proposition.\n\nStep 3. Classification of three-line covers of S_3.\n\nLet P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }. We determine the possible numbers t of sunny lines among three distinct lines that cover P.\n\nLemma 3 (sunny pair structure in S_3).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line (i.e., a line not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121) are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n\nProof.\nCompute the slopes for all 15 pairs. A direct check yields:\n- Horizontal (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the x-coordinate at fixed y (e.g., (1,1)-(2,1), (1,1)-(3,1), (2,1)-(3,1), (1,2)-(2,2)).\n- Vertical (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the y-coordinate at fixed x (e.g., (1,1)-(1,2), (1,1)-(1,3), (1,2)-(1,3), (2,1)-(2,2)).\n- Anti-diagonal (slope \u22121, non-sunny): (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(2,2), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,2)-(3,1).\n- Sunny lines (neither horizontal, vertical, nor slope \u22121): exactly\n  (1,1)-(2,2) with slope 1,\n  (1,2)-(3,1) with slope \u22121/2,\n  (1,3)-(2,1) with slope \u22122.\nNo other pair has a sunny slope. The three listed pairs are disjoint, as claimed.\n\nCorollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no covering of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nLet the three lines be L_1, L_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L_1 and L_2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L_1 \u222a L_2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line (it is collinear only on its own sunny line), so N cannot cover both of them. Hence a cover with exactly two sunny lines is impossible.\n\nProposition 5 (achievability on S_3).\nThree-line covers of P exist with exactly t sunny lines for t = 0, 1, 3:\n- t = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n- t = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\n- t = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\n\nCombining Corollary 4 and Proposition 5, the possible values are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion for general n.\n\nBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny). Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t of sunny lines among the final three lines covering S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2. Hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}, and k \u2260 2.\n\nIt remains to show achievability for all n \u2265 3. Fix n \u2265 3.\n\n- For k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines covering S_n.\n\n- For k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, and y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The first two are non-sunny; the last has slope 1 and is sunny. They cover the last three columns {(n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3), (n \u2212 1,1), (n \u2212 1,2), (n,1)} as follows:\n  x = n \u2212 2 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3);\n  y = 1 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 1,1), (n,1);\n  y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) covers (n \u2212 1,2).\n  Together with the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3, all of S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\n- For k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These three lines cover the last three columns bijectively:\n  column a = n \u2212 2: points (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3) lie on L_1, L_3, L_2, respectively;\n  column a = n \u2212 1: points (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2) lie on L_2, L_1, respectively;\n  column a = n: point (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n  Hence all of S_n is covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}."

Boundary lemma.\n\nLemma 1 (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover all points of S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of S_m. The three sides x = 1, y = 1, and x + y = m + 1 contain m, m, and m lattice points, respectively, and the three vertices are counted twice in this triple count. Therefore\n|B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not equal to any of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary of S_m in at most two points. Hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. If none of the lines L_i is a boundary side, then together they cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is strictly less than 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4. This contradicts the fact that all points of B_m must be covered. Therefore at least one L_i is a boundary side. This proves the lemma.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3.\n\nProposition 2 (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as in the boundary lemma, the remaining three lines of the original family cover S_3.\n\nProof.\nWe perform an iterative removal. Start with m := n and the set S_m = S_n.\n\n- By Lemma 1 (since m \u2265 4 at the beginning), among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\n\n- The remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}. More precisely:\n  \u2022 If we removed y = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n  \u2022 If we removed x = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n  \u2022 If we removed x + y = m + 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m}, which equals S_{m\u22121}.\n\nIn all three cases, the removed line is non-sunny, and the uncovered set is (up to translation) S_{m\u22121}. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and repeat.\n\nThis process can be iterated while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family is exactly the number of sunny lines among the remaining three lines that cover S_3. This proves the proposition.\n\nStep 3. Classification of three-line covers of S_3.\n\nLet P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }. We determine the possible numbers t of sunny lines among three distinct lines that cover P.\n\nLemma 3 (sunny pair structure in S_3).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line (i.e., a line not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121) are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n\nProof.\nCompute the slopes for all 15 pairs. A direct check yields:\n- Horizontal (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the x-coordinate at fixed y (e.g., (1,1)-(2,1), (1,1)-(3,1), (2,1)-(3,1), (1,2)-(2,2)).\n- Vertical (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the y-coordinate at fixed x (e.g., (1,1)-(1,2), (1,1)-(1,3), (1,2)-(1,3), (2,1)-(2,2)).\n- Anti-diagonal (slope \u22121, non-sunny): (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(2,2), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,2)-(3,1).\n- Sunny lines (neither horizontal, vertical, nor slope \u22121): exactly\n  (1,1)-(2,2) with slope 1,\n  (1,2)-(3,1) with slope \u22121/2,\n  (1,3)-(2,1) with slope \u22122.\nNo other pair has a sunny slope. The three listed pairs are disjoint, as claimed.\n\nCorollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no covering of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nLet the three lines be L_1, L_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L_1 and L_2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L_1 \u222a L_2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line (it is collinear only on its own sunny line), so N cannot cover both of them. Hence a cover with exactly two sunny lines is impossible.\n\nProposition 5 (achievability on S_3).\nThree-line covers of P exist with exactly t sunny lines for t = 0, 1, 3:\n- t = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n- t = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\n- t = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\n\nCombining Corollary 4 and Proposition 5, the possible values are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion for general n.\n\nBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny). Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t of sunny lines among the final three lines covering S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2. Hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3}, and k \u2260 2.\n\nIt remains to show achievability for all n \u2265 3. Fix n \u2265 3.\n\n- For k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines covering S_n.\n\n- For k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, and y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The first two are non-sunny; the last has slope 1 and is sunny. They cover the last three columns {(n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3), (n \u2212 1,1), (n \u2212 1,2), (n,1)} as follows:\n  x = n \u2212 2 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3);\n  y = 1 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 1,1), (n,1);\n  y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) covers (n \u2212 1,2).\n  Together with the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3, all of S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\n- For k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These three lines cover the last three columns bijectively:\n  column a = n \u2212 2: points (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3) lie on L_1, L_3, L_2, respectively;\n  column a = n \u2212 1: points (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2) lie on L_2, L_1, respectively;\n  column a = n: point (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n  Hence all of S_n is covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

The classification on S3 is translation-invariant, but this invariance is used implicitly and not stated. A brief clarification is needed to justify applying the S3 classification directly.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\nDefinition and setup\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 and S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n  We call a line non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or has slope \u22121, and sunny otherwise.\u201d\n  - Verification: The set S_n is correctly defined; it consists of integer lattice points in a right isosceles triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,n), (n,1). The \u201csunny\u201d definition correctly matches \u201cnot parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or the line x+y=0.\u201d\n\nStep 1. Boundary lemma\n- Statement (Lemma 1): If m \u2265 4 and m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of them is exactly one of x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n- Proof details:\n  - Quote: \u201cThe three sides x = 1, y = 1, and x + y = m + 1 contain m, m, and m lattice points, respectively, and the three vertices are counted twice in this triple count. Therefore |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. Each side has exactly m lattice points; subtracting the three double-counted vertices yields 3m \u2212 3 boundary lattice points.\n  - Quote: \u201cA line that is not equal to any of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary of S_m in at most two points. Hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. The boundary is the boundary of a convex triangle, and any line not coincident with a side intersects a convex polygon\u2019s boundary in at most two points. Thus it contains at most two boundary lattice points.\n  - Quote: \u201cIf none of the lines L_i is a boundary side, then together they cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is strictly less than 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. 2m < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4. Therefore at least one line must be equal to a boundary side. The lemma is sound.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3\n- Statement (Proposition 2): In any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. After removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides as in Lemma 1, the remaining three lines cover S_3.\n- Proof details:\n  - Quote: \u201cStart with m := n \u2026 By Lemma 1 \u2026 among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct application of Lemma 1 for m \u2265 4.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}\u2026\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. Removing y=1 produces {(a,b): a\u22651, b\u22652, a+b \u2264 m+1}, which translates to S_{m\u22121} by (a,b)\u21a6(a,b\u22121). Removing x=1 similarly translates by (a,b)\u21a6(a\u22121,b). Removing x+y=m+1 yields {(a,b): a\u22651, b\u22651, a+b \u2264 m}, which equals S_{m\u22121}. In all cases the removed line is non-sunny.\n  - Quote: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and repeat \u2026 After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3.\u201d\n    - Verification: The iterative process is valid while m \u2265 4. Each step removes exactly one non-sunny boundary side. After n \u2212 3 steps, three lines remain that cover the remaining set of lattice points.\n    - Issue (Justification Gap, minor): The remaining set after peeling is a translate (congruent copy) of S_3, not necessarily S_3 itself. The solution then applies a classification explicitly on S_3 in Step 3. This is harmless because the classification is translation-invariant, but the invariance is not stated. A one-sentence clarification would close this gap.\n  - Conclusion: From the peeling, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, hence k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family equals the number among the final three.\n\nStep 3. Classification for S_3\n- Setup: P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n- Lemma 3 (sunny pair structure):\n  - Quote: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line \u2026 are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\u201d\n  - Verification: A direct enumeration of the 15 pairs shows:\n    - Horizontal: pairs with equal y (non-sunny).\n    - Vertical: pairs with equal x (non-sunny).\n    - Slope \u22121: the anti-diagonals (non-sunny).\n    - Remaining sunny pairs are exactly the three listed with slopes 1, \u22121/2, \u22122. These three pairs are disjoint. This lemma is correct.\n- Corollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3):\n  - Quote: \u201cLet the three lines be L1, L2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L1 and L2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L1 \u222a L2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line \u2026 so N cannot cover both of them.\u201d\n  - Assessment: The conclusion (no cover with exactly two sunny lines) is true; however, the argument provided is incomplete.\n  - Issue (Justification Gap): The reasoning assumes that L1 and L2 together cover exactly four points (i.e., that each sunny line meets P in two points and the two pairs are disjoint). It does not address the possibilities that a sunny line might intersect P in only one point, or that the two sunny lines might overlap on a point of P, in which cases L1 \u222a L2 could cover three or fewer points. Without ruling out these configurations (and analyzing how a non-sunny line could or could not cover the remainder), the deduction that the two uncovered points must be \u201cthe remaining sunny pair\u201d is not justified. Further casework is needed to complete this impossibility proof.\n  - As per instructions: Assume the corollary\u2019s conclusion is true for the sake of argument and proceed to verify the rest.\n- Proposition 5 (achievability on S_3):\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: x=1 covers (1,1),(1,2),(1,3); y=1 covers (1,1),(2,1),(3,1); x+y=4 covers (1,3),(2,2),(3,1). Union is P. All lines are non-sunny. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: x=1 covers the first column; y=1 covers the bottom row; y=x covers (1,1) and (2,2). Together they cover P. Exactly one sunny line. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: The three lines through the disjoint pairs (1,1)-(2,2), (1,2)-(3,1), (1,3)-(2,1) cover all six points without overlap. All are sunny. Correct.\n\nStep 4. General n and constructions\n- Reduction:\n  - Quote: \u201cBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 \u2026 Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t \u2026 on S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.\u201d\n  - Verification: Given the peeling (with the minor translation note above), this is sound provided Corollary 4 holds. This step uses the Justification Gap in Corollary 4 to exclude k = 2.\n- Achievability for all n \u2265 3:\n  - Case k = 0:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n    - Verification: These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals x=1,\u2026,x=n\u22122 cover all columns up to n\u22122. The remaining points are (n\u22121,1), (n\u22121,2), (n,1), covered by y=1 and x+y=n+1. Correct.\n  - Case k = 1:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three lines x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, and y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n    - Verification: Total n lines, exactly one sunny (slope 1). Coverage: verticals cover columns up to n\u22123; x = n \u2212 2 covers (n\u22122,1),(n\u22122,2),(n\u22122,3); y = 1 covers (n\u22122,1),(n\u22121,1),(n,1); y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) covers (n\u22121,2). These account for all remaining points in columns n\u22122, n\u22121, n. Correct.\n  - Case k = 3:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three sunny lines L1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), L2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), L3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2).\u201d\n    - Verification: L1 has slope 1; L2 slope \u22122; L3 slope \u22121/2; all sunny and distinct. They cover columns n\u22122, n\u22121, n exactly as stated: (n\u22122,1)\u2208L1, (n\u22122,2)\u2208L3, (n\u22122,3)\u2208L2; (n\u22121,1)\u2208L2, (n\u22121,2)\u2208L1; (n,1)\u2208L3. Vertical lines cover columns up to n\u22123. Correct.\n\nConclusion\n- The constructions show k \u2208 {0,1,3} are achievable for all n \u2265 3. The upper bound k \u2264 3 is justified by peeling. The only missing rigorous piece is the exclusion of k = 2, which relies on Corollary 4 and, as written, contains a Justification Gap."

Therefore at least one line must be equal to a boundary side. The lemma is sound.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3\n- Statement (Proposition 2): In any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. After removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides as in Lemma 1, the remaining three lines cover S_3.\n- Proof details:\n  - Quote: \u201cStart with m := n \u2026 By Lemma 1 \u2026 among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct application of Lemma 1 for m \u2265 4.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}\u2026\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct.

Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3.\u201d\n    - Verification: The iterative process is valid while m \u2265 4. Each step removes exactly one non-sunny boundary side. After n \u2212 3 steps, three lines remain that cover the remaining set of lattice points.\n    - Issue (Justification Gap, minor): The remaining set after peeling is a translate (congruent copy) of S_3, not necessarily S_3 itself. The solution then applies a classification explicitly on S_3 in Step 3. This is harmless because the classification is translation-invariant, but the invariance is not stated. A one-sentence clarification would close this gap.\n  - Conclusion: From the peeling, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, hence k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family equals the number among the final three.\n\nStep 3. Classification for S_3\n- Setup: P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n- Lemma 3 (sunny pair structure):\n  - Quote: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line \u2026 are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\u201d\n  - Verification: A direct enumeration of the 15 pairs shows:\n    - Horizontal: pairs with equal y (non-sunny).\n    - Vertical: pairs with equal x (non-sunny).\n    - Slope \u22121: the anti-diagonals (non-sunny).\n    - Remaining sunny pairs are exactly the three listed with slopes 1, \u22121/2, \u22122. These three pairs are disjoint. This lemma is correct.\n- Corollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3):\n  - Quote: \u201cLet the three lines be L1, L2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L1 and L2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L1 \u222a L2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line \u2026 so N cannot cover both of them.\u201d\n  - Assessment: The conclusion (no cover with exactly two sunny lines) is true; however, the argument provided is incomplete.\n  - Issue (Justification Gap): The reasoning assumes that L1 and L2 together cover exactly four points (i.e., that each sunny line meets P in two points and the two pairs are disjoint). It does not address the possibilities that a sunny line might intersect P in only one point, or that the two sunny lines might overlap on a point of P, in which cases L1 \u222a L2 could cover three or fewer points. Without ruling out these configurations (and analyzing how a non-sunny line could or could not cover the remainder), the deduction that the two uncovered points must be \u201cthe remaining sunny pair\u201d is not justified. Further casework is needed to complete this impossibility proof.\n  - As per instructions: Assume the corollary\u2019s conclusion is true for the sake of argument and proceed to verify the rest.\n- Proposition 5 (achievability on S_3):\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: x=1 covers (1,1),(1,2),(1,3); y=1 covers (1,1),(2,1),(3,1); x+y=4 covers (1,3),(2,2),(3,1). Union is P. All lines are non-sunny. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: x=1 covers the first column; y=1 covers the bottom row; y=x covers (1,1) and (2,2). Together they cover P. Exactly one sunny line. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201ct = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: The three lines through the disjoint pairs (1,1)-(2,2), (1,2)-(3,1), (1,3)-(2,1) cover all six points without overlap. All are sunny. Correct.\n\nStep 4. General n and constructions\n- Reduction:\n  - Quote: \u201cBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 \u2026 Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t \u2026 on S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.\u201d\n  - Verification: Given the peeling (with the minor translation note above), this is sound provided Corollary 4 holds. This step uses the Justification Gap in Corollary 4 to exclude k = 2.\n- Achievability for all n \u2265 3:\n  - Case k = 0:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n lines x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n    - Verification: These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals x=1,\u2026,x=n\u22122 cover all columns up to n\u22122. The remaining points are (n\u22121,1), (n\u22121,2), (n,1), covered by y=1 and x+y=n+1. Correct.\n  - Case k = 1:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three lines x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, and y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n    - Verification: Total n lines, exactly one sunny (slope 1). Coverage: verticals cover columns up to n\u22123; x = n \u2212 2 covers (n\u22122,1),(n\u22122,2),(n\u22122,3); y = 1 covers (n\u22122,1),(n\u22121,1),(n,1); y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) covers (n\u22121,2). These account for all remaining points in columns n\u22122, n\u22121, n. Correct.\n  - Case k = 3:\n    - Quote: \u201cTake the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three sunny lines L1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), L2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), L3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2).\u201d\n    - Verification: L1 has slope 1; L2 slope \u22122; L3 slope \u22121/2; all sunny and distinct. They cover columns n\u22122, n\u22121, n exactly as stated: (n\u22122,1)\u2208L1, (n\u22122,2)\u2208L3, (n\u22122,3)\u2208L2; (n\u22121,1)\u2208L2, (n\u22121,2)\u2208L1; (n,1)\u2208L3. Vertical lines cover columns up to n\u22123. Correct.\n\nConclusion\n- The constructions show k \u2208 {0,1,3} are achievable for all n \u2265 3. The upper bound k \u2264 3 is justified by peeling. The only missing rigorous piece is the exclusion of k = 2, which relies on Corollary 4 and, as written, contains a Justification Gap."

Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\nAssistant: 1. Summary\n\na. Verdict:\nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is: for every integer n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}. In particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny if and only if it is not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121 (equivalently, not parallel to any of the three sides of the triangular lattice region S_n).\n\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of these lines is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n  Proof idea: The set of boundary lattice points of S_m has cardinality 3m \u2212 3. Any line that is not one of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary in at most two points; hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. Therefore m such lines cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\n\n- Peeling (iterative reduction): Starting from S_n and any covering by n distinct lines, apply the boundary lemma to remove one side of S_n (which is a non-sunny line) together with the points it covers. The uncovered set is a smaller lattice triangle (precisely S_{n\u22121} up to translation). Repeat while the current size m \u2265 4. After n \u2212 3 steps, exactly three original lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines were non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. Moreover, the number of sunny lines in the original family equals the number of sunny lines among these final three lines that cover S_3.\n\n- Classification for S_3:\n  Let P := S_3 = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)}. A direct check shows that the only sunny lines through two points of P are exactly the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n  {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n  Consequently, two sunny lines can cover at most four points of P, leaving the remaining two as one of these three \u201csunny pairs,\u201d which are not collinear on any non-sunny line. Hence S_3 cannot be covered by three lines with exactly two sunny lines. On the other hand:\n  - 0 sunny: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n  - 1 sunny: x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) cover P.\n  - 3 sunny: the three pair-lines above cover P.\n\n- Lifting to general n:\n  To realize k \u2208 {0,1,3} for S_n, take the above three-line configurations on the \u201clast three columns\u201d and add n \u2212 3 boundary sides (e.g., the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3). The covering property holds, the total number of lines is n, and the number of sunny lines is exactly k. Since k = 2 is impossible already for S_3, it is impossible for S_n.\n\nKey lemmas/results used:\n- Boundary lemma: In any cover of S_m by m lines with m \u2265 4, one line is a boundary side.\n- Reduction lemma: Removing a boundary side of S_m leaves a set affinely congruent (by a translation) to S_{m\u22121}.\n- S_3 classification: Three lines cover S_3 with exactly t sunny lines if and only if t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 and S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\n\nWe call a line non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or has slope \u22121, and sunny otherwise.\n\nStep 1. Boundary lemma.\n\nLemma 1 (boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover all points of S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of S_m. The three sides x = 1, y = 1, and x + y = m + 1 contain m, m, and m lattice points, respectively, and the three vertices are counted twice in this triple count. Therefore\n|B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\n\nA line that is not equal to any of the three sides intersects the polygonal boundary of S_m in at most two points. Hence it contains at most two boundary lattice points. If none of the lines L_i is a boundary side, then together they cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is strictly less than 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4. This contradicts the fact that all points of B_m must be covered. Therefore at least one L_i is a boundary side. This proves the lemma.\n\nStep 2. Peeling reduction to S_3.\n\nProposition 2 (peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Equivalently, the number k of sunny lines satisfies k \u2264 3. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as in the boundary lemma, the remaining three lines of the original family cover S_3.\n\nProof.\nWe perform an iterative removal. Start with m := n and the set S_m = S_n.\n\n- By Lemma 1 (since m \u2265 4 at the beginning), among the covering lines there exists a boundary side of S_m. Remove this line and all points of S_m lying on it.\n\n- The remaining uncovered set is again a triangular lattice set congruent to S_{m\u22121}. More precisely:\n  \u2022 If we removed y = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a, b \u2212 1).\n  \u2022 If we removed x = 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is translated to S_{m\u22121} by (a, b) \u21a6 (a \u2212 1, b).\n  \u2022 If we removed x + y = m + 1, the remaining set is {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m}, which equals S_{m\u22121}.\n\nIn all three cases, the removed line is non-sunny, and the uncovered set is (up to translation) S_{m\u22121}. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and repeat.\n\nThis process can be iterated while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S_3. Hence at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, so k \u2264 3, and the number of sunny lines in the original family is exactly the number of sunny lines among the remaining three lines that cover S_3. This proves the proposition.\n\nStep 3. Classification of three-line covers of S_3.\n\nLet P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }. We determine the possible numbers t of sunny lines among three distinct lines that cover P.\n\nLemma 3 (sunny pair structure in S_3).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line (i.e., a line not horizontal, not vertical, and not of slope \u22121) are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\n\nProof.\nCompute the slopes for all 15 pairs. A direct check yields:\n- Horizontal (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the x-coordinate at fixed y (e.g., (1,1)-(2,1), (1,1)-(3,1), (2,1)-(3,1), (1,2)-(2,2)).\n- Vertical (non-sunny): pairs differing only in the y-coordinate at fixed x (e.g., (1,1)-(1,2), (1,1)-(1,3), (1,2)-(1,3), (2,1)-(2,2)).\n- Anti-diagonal (slope \u22121, non-sunny): (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(2,2), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,2)-(3,1).\n- Sunny lines (neither horizontal, vertical, nor slope \u22121): exactly\n  (1,1)-(2,2) with slope 1,\n  (1,2)-(3,1) with slope \u22121/2,\n  (1,3)-(2,1) with slope \u22122.\nNo other pair has a sunny slope. The three listed pairs are disjoint, as claimed.\n\nCorollary 4 (impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no covering of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nLet the three lines be L_1, L_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny). By Lemma 3, each of L_1 and L_2 can cover at most two points of P, and if it covers two points, they must be one of the three specific sunny pairs. Therefore L_1 \u222a L_2 covers at most four points, in which case the two uncovered points must be exactly the remaining pair among the three sunny pairs of Lemma 3. That remaining pair is not collinear on any non-sunny line (it is collinear only on its own sunny line), so N cannot cover both of them. Hence a cover with exactly two sunny lines is impossible.\n\nProposition 5 (achievability on S_3).\nThree-line covers of P exist with exactly t sunny lines for t = 0, 1, 3:\n- t = 0: the three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P.\n- t = 1: the lines x = 1, y = 1, and the sunny line through (1,1) and (2,2) (i.e., y = x) cover P.\n- t = 3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover P.\n\nCombining Corollary 4 and Proposition 5, the possible values are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion for general n.\n\nBy Proposition 2, any cover of S_n by n distinct lines reduces to a three-line cover of S_3 after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny). Therefore the number k of sunny lines in the original cover equals the number t of sunny lines among the final three lines covering S_3. By the S_3 classification, t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.

Fix n \u2265 3.\n\n- For k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines covering S_n.\n\n- For k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, and y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The first two are non-sunny; the last has slope 1 and is sunny. They cover the last three columns {(n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3), (n \u2212 1,1), (n \u2212 1,2), (n,1)} as follows:\n  x = n \u2212 2 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 2,2), (n \u2212 2,3);\n  y = 1 covers (n \u2212 2,1), (n \u2212 1,1), (n,1);\n  y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3) covers (n \u2212 1,2).\n  Together with the verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3, all of S_n is covered, and exactly one line is sunny.\n\n- For k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 vertical lines x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 together with the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These three lines cover the last three columns bijectively:\n  column a = n \u2212 2: points (n \u2212 2, 1), (n \u2212 2, 2), (n \u2212 2, 3) lie on L_1, L_3, L_2, respectively;\n  column a = n \u2212 1: points (n \u2212 1, 1), (n \u2212 1, 2) lie on L_2, L_1, respectively;\n  column a = n: point (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n  Hence all of S_n is covered, and exactly three lines are sunny.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\nUser: \nBelow is the bug report.

It does not rule out the possibility that one or both sunny lines cover only one point, in which case the two uncovered points need not be \u201cthe remaining pair\u201d from Lemma 3. Additional case analysis is required to complete the impossibility of exactly two sunny lines.\n- Location: \u201cAfter exactly n \u2212 3 iterations, we arrive at m = 3, having removed n \u2212 3 boundary sides, all non-sunny. Exactly three of the original n lines remain and cover S3.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap (minor) \u2014 The peeling operation leaves a translate of S3, not necessarily S3 itself. The classification on S3 is translation-invariant, but this invariance is used implicitly and not stated. A brief clarification is needed to justify applying the S3 classification directly."

The final answer is: for every integer n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}; in particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny iff it is not parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or to x + y = 0 (i.e., not of slope 0, \u221e, or \u22121).\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of them is exactly a boundary side of the triangular lattice region, i.e., x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n- Peeling reduction: Iteratively remove such a boundary side (necessarily non-sunny) and the points it covers. The uncovered set is a translate of S_{m\u22121}. After n \u2212 3 steps, three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Translations preserve parallelism, hence preserve the sunny/non-sunny status; thus the number of sunny lines among the last three equals the number of sunny lines in a three-line cover of S_3.\n- Classification on S_3:\n  \u2022 Let P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n  \u2022 The only sunny lines through two points of P are the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n    {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}; each contains exactly two points of P, and no sunny line contains three points of P.\n  \u2022 Any non-sunny line contains at most three points of P; those with three points are exactly the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4; those with exactly two points are x = 2, y = 2, x + y = 3.\n  \u2022 Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines: In any three-line cover with exactly two sunny lines, the remaining non-sunny line either has \u2264 2 points (which forces a partition of P into three pairs, but then the remaining four points cannot split into two sunny pairs), or \u2265 3 points (hence is a boundary side), but then the remaining three points are mutually non-sunny-paired, so two sunny lines cannot cover them. Hence t = 2 is impossible for S_3.\n  \u2022 Achievability for t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} is given by explicit configurations.\n- Lifting to S_n: By peeling, k \u2264 3. The number k equals the number of sunny lines among the final three covering a translate of S_3, hence k \u2208 {0,1,3}. Explicit constructions provide all three values for every n \u2265 3.\n\nKey lemmas/results:\n- Boundary lemma for S_m (m \u2265 4).\n- Peeling reduction (translation invariance of sunny/non-sunny).\n- S_3 classification: t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}."

Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny.

By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny.

A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}."

    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: \"The solution is correct,\" \"The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid,\" or \"The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps.\"\n    *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:\n        *   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.\n        *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).\n\n*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**\n    Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.\n\n**Example of the Required Summary Format**\n*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get...\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.\n*   **Location:** \"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A-C > B-D$\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy. Subtracting inequalities in this manner is not a valid mathematical operation.\n\n\n\nUser: \n======================================================================\n### Problem ###\n\n*** Problem Statement ***\n\nA line in the plane is called *sunny* if it is not parallel to any of the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=0$.\n\nLet $n\\ge3$ be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - Verification of the three cases:\n      - Removing y = 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = (0, \u22121) + S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n      - Removing x = 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = (\u22121, 0) + S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n      - Removing x + y = m + 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m} = S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n    - Each removed line is non-sunny (horizontal, vertical, or slope \u22121). Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap. Lemma 1 is stated specifically for S_m (with given vertex positions). After one peeling step, U is a translate of S_{m\u22121}, not S_{m\u22121} itself. The proof does not explicitly justify reapplying Lemma 1 in this translated frame. This can be justified either by transporting the configuration back via translation (which preserves lines and boundary point counts) or by redoing the boundary-lattice counting argument for translates; however, this justification is not explicitly given.\n    - For the sake of argument, we assume this reapplication is valid. The rest of the reasoning then follows: we remove exactly n \u2212 3 non-sunny boundary lines, leaving three lines that cover a translate of S_3.\n  - Conclusion under the assumption: The lemma\u2019s conclusions (at least n \u2212 3 non-sunny lines; three remaining lines cover a translate of S_3) are correct.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: Correct. This is later used to reduce the last step to S_3 without changing the count of sunny lines.\n\n5) Reduction to S_3 and definition of P\n- Quote: \u201cWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\u201d\n- Verification: Correct.\n\n6) Lemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Quote: \u201cCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal \u2026 vertical \u2026 and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 \u2026 \u22121/2 \u2026 and \u22122 \u2026\u201d\n    - Verification: Exhaustive check on the 15 pairs confirms only these three pairs give slopes not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cEach of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points.\u201d\n    - Verification: Check shows none of these lines passes through a third point of P. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cNo sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n    - Verification: Follows from the previous observation: the only sunny lines that exist through points of P contain exactly two points of P. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Lemma 3 is correct.\n\n7) Lemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Verification by inspection:\n    - Vertical: x=1 has three points {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)}; x=2 has two; x=3 has one. Correct.\n    - Horizontal: y=1 has three points {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)}; y=2 has two; y=3 has one. Correct.\n    - Diagonal slope \u22121: x+y=2 has one; x+y=3 has two; x+y=4 has three. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Lemma 4 is correct.\n\n8) Proposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3)\n- Statement: \u201cThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Setup: Let S_1, S_2 be sunny and N non-sunny, covering P.\n  - Case 1: N contains at most two points of P.\n    - Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n      - Verification: Since N covers at most two points and each sunny line covers at most two, the total number of covered points counting multiplicity is \u2264 6. To cover all 6 distinct points, each line must cover exactly two, and the three sets must be disjoint. Correct.\n    - Subcases using Lemma 4:\n      - N = x = 2 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,2),(3,1)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n      - N = y = 2 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,3),(2,1)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n      - N = x + y = 3 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,1),(2,2)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n  - Case 2: N contains at least three points of P.\n    - By Lemma 4, N is one of x=1, y=1, x+y=4. In each case, the remaining set Q of three points has all pairwise connections on non-sunny lines (vertical/horizontal/slope \u22121), so no sunny line contains two of them. Thus two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q; contradiction. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Proposition 5 is correct.\n\n9) Proposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Statement: \u201cThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - t = 0: x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P; all non-sunny. Correct.\n  - t = 1: x = 1, y = 1, and y = x cover P; y = x is sunny; the others are non-sunny. Correct.\n  - t = 3: The three sunny lines from Lemma 3 cover the six points (two points per line) and are all sunny. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Proposition 6 is correct.\n\n10) Conclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Assuming the iterative application of Lemma 1 to translates (see the noted Justification Gap) is valid, exactly n \u2212 3 removed lines are boundary sides (thus non-sunny), so the number of sunny lines among the original n is precisely the number of sunny lines among the remaining three; translation invariance allows us to analyze S_3. Since t \u2208 {0,1,3} by Propositions 5 and 6, k \u2208 {0,1,3}. Also, at least n \u2212 3 lines must be non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. Correct under the assumption.\n\n11) Constructions achieving k \u2208 {0,1,3} for general n \u2265 3\n- k = 0:\n  - Lines: x = 1, 2, \u2026, n \u2212 2; y = 1; x + y = n + 1 (n lines, all non-sunny).\n  - Coverage: For a \u2264 n \u2212 2, covered by x = a; For a = n \u2212 1, points (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) covered by y = 1 and x + y = n + 1; For a = n, point (n,1) covered by y = 1. Correct.\n- k = 1:\n  - Lines: x = 1, \u2026, n \u2212 3; x = n \u2212 2; y = 1; y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3). Exactly one sunny line (slope 1). Distinctness holds.\n  - Coverage: Columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 covered by verticals; For a = n \u2212 2, points with b = 1,2,3 on x = n \u2212 2; For a = n \u2212 1, points (n \u2212 1, 1) on y = 1 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3); For a = n, (n,1) on y = 1. Correct.\n- k = 3:\n  - Lines: verticals x = 1, \u2026, n \u2212 3 and three sunny lines\n    - L1 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n    - L2 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n    - L3 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  - Coverage: The last three columns are covered as stated: (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 on L1, L3, L2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) on L2; (n \u2212 1, 2) on L1; (n, 1) on L3. Columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 covered by verticals. All three added lines are sunny and distinct; none is vertical/horizontal/\u22121 slope. Correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- Except for the minor Justification Gap noted in the iterative use of Lemma 1 on translated copies of S_m, the reasoning is correct and complete. Assuming this standard and easily supplied justification, the solution cleanly establishes that the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3} and provides constructions for each value."

"Summary\n\nFinal Verdict: The solution\u2019s approach is sound and essentially complete, but it contains a minor Justification Gap in the iterative use of Lemma 1.\n\nList of Findings:\n- Location: \u201cBy Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. \u2026 Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 Lemma 1 is stated for S_m with vertices at (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). In the iteration, U becomes a translate of S_{m\u22121}. The proof does not explicitly justify that Lemma 1 applies unchanged to translates of S_m (though it does by the same boundary-point count or via translation). We will assume this step holds for the sake of argument and verify the rest.\n\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Definitions and setup\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: Correct restatement. \u201cSunny\u201d matches \u201cnot parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or the line x + y = 0.\u201d\n\n2) Lemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Statement: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Quote: \u201cThe three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n    - Verification: The sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = m + 1 indeed contain m integer lattice points each; summing gives 3m, with the three vertices each counted twice in this sum, so the union has size 3m \u2212 3. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cA line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points\u2026\u201d\n    - Verification: For a convex polygon, any line not coincident with a side intersects the boundary in at most two points. Hence each L_i can cover at most two boundary points, so the union of the boundary points covered by m such lines is at most 2m. The fact that some lines might cover fewer than two boundary lattice points only strengthens the inequality. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201c\u2026which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\u201d\n    - Verification: 2m < 3m \u2212 3 iff m > 3. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Lemma 1 is valid.\n\n3) Lemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Statement: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) \u2026 the remaining three lines cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Quote: \u201cInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1 \u2026 remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - Verification of the three cases:\n      - Removing y = 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = (0, \u22121) + S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n      - Removing x = 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = (\u22121, 0) + S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n      - Removing x + y = m + 1 leaves {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m} = S_{m\u22121}. Correct.\n    - Each removed line is non-sunny (horizontal, vertical, or slope \u22121). Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap. Lemma 1 is stated specifically for S_m (with given vertex positions). After one peeling step, U is a translate of S_{m\u22121}, not S_{m\u22121} itself. The proof does not explicitly justify reapplying Lemma 1 in this translated frame. This can be justified either by transporting the configuration back via translation (which preserves lines and boundary point counts) or by redoing the boundary-lattice counting argument for translates; however, this justification is not explicitly given.\n    - For the sake of argument, we assume this reapplication is valid. The rest of the reasoning then follows: we remove exactly n \u2212 3 non-sunny boundary lines, leaving three lines that cover a translate of S_3.\n  - Conclusion under the assumption: The lemma\u2019s conclusions (at least n \u2212 3 non-sunny lines; three remaining lines cover a translate of S_3) are correct.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: Correct. This is later used to reduce the last step to S_3 without changing the count of sunny lines.\n\n5) Reduction to S_3 and definition of P\n- Quote: \u201cWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\u201d\n- Verification: Correct.\n\n6) Lemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Quote: \u201cCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal \u2026 vertical \u2026 and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 \u2026 \u22121/2 \u2026 and \u22122 \u2026\u201d\n    - Verification: Exhaustive check on the 15 pairs confirms only these three pairs give slopes not in {0, \u221e, \u22121}. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cEach of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points.\u201d\n    - Verification: Check shows none of these lines passes through a third point of P. Correct.\n  - Quote: \u201cNo sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n    - Verification: Follows from the previous observation: the only sunny lines that exist through points of P contain exactly two points of P. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Lemma 3 is correct.\n\n7) Lemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Verification by inspection:\n    - Vertical: x=1 has three points {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)}; x=2 has two; x=3 has one. Correct.\n    - Horizontal: y=1 has three points {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)}; y=2 has two; y=3 has one. Correct.\n    - Diagonal slope \u22121: x+y=2 has one; x+y=3 has two; x+y=4 has three. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Lemma 4 is correct.\n\n8) Proposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3)\n- Statement: \u201cThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - Setup: Let S_1, S_2 be sunny and N non-sunny, covering P.\n  - Case 1: N contains at most two points of P.\n    - Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n      - Verification: Since N covers at most two points and each sunny line covers at most two, the total number of covered points counting multiplicity is \u2264 6. To cover all 6 distinct points, each line must cover exactly two, and the three sets must be disjoint. Correct.\n    - Subcases using Lemma 4:\n      - N = x = 2 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,2),(3,1)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n      - N = y = 2 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,3),(2,1)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n      - N = x + y = 3 leaves R = {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}; only sunny pair among R is {(1,1),(2,2)}; cannot partition R into two sunny pairs. Correct.\n  - Case 2: N contains at least three points of P.\n    - By Lemma 4, N is one of x=1, y=1, x+y=4. In each case, the remaining set Q of three points has all pairwise connections on non-sunny lines (vertical/horizontal/slope \u22121), so no sunny line contains two of them. Thus two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q; contradiction. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Proposition 5 is correct.\n\n9) Proposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Statement: \u201cThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\u201d\n- Proof check:\n  - t = 0: x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4 cover P; all non-sunny. Correct.\n  - t = 1: x = 1, y = 1, and y = x cover P; y = x is sunny; the others are non-sunny. Correct.\n  - t = 3: The three sunny lines from Lemma 3 cover the six points (two points per line) and are all sunny. Correct.\n  - Conclusion: Proposition 6 is correct.\n\n10) Conclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Assuming the iterative application of Lemma 1 to translates (see the noted Justification Gap) is valid, exactly n \u2212 3 removed lines are boundary sides (thus non-sunny), so the number of sunny lines among the original n is precisely the number of sunny lines among the remaining three; translation invariance allows us to analyze S_3. Since t \u2208 {0,1,3} by Propositions 5 and 6, k \u2208 {0,1,3}. Also, at least n \u2212 3 lines must be non-sunny, so k \u2264 3. Correct under the assumption.\n\n11) Constructions achieving k \u2208 {0,1,3} for general n \u2265 3\n- k = 0:\n  - Lines: x = 1, 2, \u2026, n \u2212 2; y = 1; x + y = n + 1 (n lines, all non-sunny).\n  - Coverage: For a \u2264 n \u2212 2, covered by x = a; For a = n \u2212 1, points (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) covered by y = 1 and x + y = n + 1; For a = n, point (n,1) covered by y = 1. Correct.\n- k = 1:\n  - Lines: x = 1, \u2026, n \u2212 3; x = n \u2212 2; y = 1; y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3). Exactly one sunny line (slope 1). Distinctness holds.\n  - Coverage: Columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 covered by verticals; For a = n \u2212 2, points with b = 1,2,3 on x = n \u2212 2; For a = n \u2212 1, points (n \u2212 1, 1) on y = 1 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3); For a = n, (n,1) on y = 1. Correct.\n- k = 3:\n  - Lines: verticals x = 1, \u2026, n \u2212 3 and three sunny lines\n    - L1 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n    - L2 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n    - L3 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  - Coverage: The last three columns are covered as stated: (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 on L1, L3, L2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) on L2; (n \u2212 1, 2) on L1; (n, 1) on L3. Columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3 covered by verticals. All three added lines are sunny and distinct; none is vertical/horizontal/\u22121 slope. Correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- Except for the minor Justification Gap noted in the iterative use of Lemma 1 on translated copies of S_m, the reasoning is correct and complete. Assuming this standard and easily supplied justification, the solution cleanly establishes that the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3} and provides constructions for each value."

    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: \"The solution is correct,\" \"The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid,\" or \"The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps.\"\n    *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:\n        *   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.\n        *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).\n\n*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**\n    Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.\n\n**Example of the Required Summary Format**\n*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get...\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.\n*   **Location:** \"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A-C > B-D$\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy. Subtracting inequalities in this manner is not a valid mathematical operation.\n\n\n\nUser: \n======================================================================\n### Problem ###\n\n*** Problem Statement ***\n\nA line in the plane is called *sunny* if it is not parallel to any of the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=0$.\n\nLet $n\\ge3$ be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader. Now, generate the **summary** and the **step-by-step verification log** for the solution above.

Every step is rigorously justified, and all claims follow logically from the arguments provided.\n\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Definitions and setup\n- Quote: \"Let n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\"\n- Verification: This correctly translates the problem\u2019s covering condition into covering the finite set S_n and matches the given definition of \u201csunny\u201d (not parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0).\n\n2) Lemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Quote: \"Let m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\"\n- Proof checkpoints:\n  - \"The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, ... so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\" Correct: Each side has m lattice points; subtract 3 for double-counted vertices.\n  - \"A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex).\" Correct: For a convex polygon, a line not coincident with a side meets the boundary in at most two points; hence it can cover at most two boundary lattice points.\n  - \"\u2026 together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\" Correct inequality and logic. Therefore at least one line must be a supporting line of a side, i.e., x=1, y=1, or x+y=m+1.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 1 is valid.\n\n3) Lemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Quote: \"In any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) ... the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\"\n- Verification:\n  - The iterative argument: Start with U = S_n. By Lemma 1, remove a boundary side of U; the remaining lines still cover the leftover set because every removed point was on the removed line.\n  - Quote: \"The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\" The three cases are correctly computed:\n    - Removing y=1 leaves {(a,b): a\u22651, b\u22652, a+b\u2264m+1}, a translate of S_{m\u22121} by (0,\u22121).\n    - Removing x=1 leaves a translate by (\u22121,0).\n    - Removing x+y=m+1 leaves S_{m\u22121} itself.\n  - All boundary sides are non-sunny (vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121).\n  - After n\u22123 iterations, m=3 and three original lines remain covering a translate of S_3.\n- Note: Applying Lemma 1 at each step to a translate of S_m is justified because the boundary-counting argument and convexity are translation-invariant.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 2 holds; at least n\u22123 lines are non-sunny, and the remaining three cover a translate of S_3.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \"Translations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\"\n- Verification: Correct and will be used to reduce the final three-line analysis to the specific set S_3.\n\n5) Definition of P and enumeration groundwork\n- Quote: \"P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\"\n- Verification: Correct listing of S_3.\n\n6) Lemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Quote: \"Among all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are ... {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\"\n- Verification:\n  - Exhaustive pairwise slope check shows all other pairs are vertical, horizontal, or have slope \u22121.\n  - The three listed sunny lines have slopes 1, \u22121/2, and \u22122, respectively, and each contains exactly the two indicated points in P (no third P lies on these lines).\n  - \"No sunny line contains three points of P\": follows because any such line would be determined by a pair; the only sunny pairs define exactly these three lines, and each misses the other three points.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 3 is correct.\n\n7) Lemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Quote: \"A non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.

To cover all 6 points with three lines of capacity \u2264 2, each must cover exactly 2 disjoint points. Therefore N must be one of x=2, y=2, or x+y=3.\n  - For each of the three N, the remaining four points admit only one sunny pair (as verified explicitly), so they cannot be partitioned into two sunny pairs.

"Summary\n\nFinal Verdict: The solution is correct.\n\nList of Findings:\n- No issues found. Every step is rigorously justified, and all claims follow logically from the arguments provided.\n\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Definitions and setup\n- Quote: \"Let n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\"\n- Verification: This correctly translates the problem\u2019s covering condition into covering the finite set S_n and matches the given definition of \u201csunny\u201d (not parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0).\n\n2) Lemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Quote: \"Let m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\"\n- Proof checkpoints:\n  - \"The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, ... so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\" Correct: Each side has m lattice points; subtract 3 for double-counted vertices.\n  - \"A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex).\" Correct: For a convex polygon, a line not coincident with a side meets the boundary in at most two points; hence it can cover at most two boundary lattice points.\n  - \"\u2026 together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\" Correct inequality and logic. Therefore at least one line must be a supporting line of a side, i.e., x=1, y=1, or x+y=m+1.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 1 is valid.\n\n3) Lemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Quote: \"In any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) ... the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\"\n- Verification:\n  - The iterative argument: Start with U = S_n. By Lemma 1, remove a boundary side of U; the remaining lines still cover the leftover set because every removed point was on the removed line.\n  - Quote: \"The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\" The three cases are correctly computed:\n    - Removing y=1 leaves {(a,b): a\u22651, b\u22652, a+b\u2264m+1}, a translate of S_{m\u22121} by (0,\u22121).\n    - Removing x=1 leaves a translate by (\u22121,0).\n    - Removing x+y=m+1 leaves S_{m\u22121} itself.\n  - All boundary sides are non-sunny (vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121).\n  - After n\u22123 iterations, m=3 and three original lines remain covering a translate of S_3.\n- Note: Applying Lemma 1 at each step to a translate of S_m is justified because the boundary-counting argument and convexity are translation-invariant.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 2 holds; at least n\u22123 lines are non-sunny, and the remaining three cover a translate of S_3.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \"Translations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\"\n- Verification: Correct and will be used to reduce the final three-line analysis to the specific set S_3.\n\n5) Definition of P and enumeration groundwork\n- Quote: \"P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\"\n- Verification: Correct listing of S_3.\n\n6) Lemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Quote: \"Among all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are ... {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\"\n- Verification:\n  - Exhaustive pairwise slope check shows all other pairs are vertical, horizontal, or have slope \u22121.\n  - The three listed sunny lines have slopes 1, \u22121/2, and \u22122, respectively, and each contains exactly the two indicated points in P (no third P lies on these lines).\n  - \"No sunny line contains three points of P\": follows because any such line would be determined by a pair; the only sunny pairs define exactly these three lines, and each misses the other three points.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 3 is correct.\n\n7) Lemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Quote: \"A non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\"\n- Verification by inspection:\n  - Columns x=1 (3 pts), x=2 (2 pts), x=3 (1 pt); rows y=1 (3 pts), y=2 (2 pts), y=3 (1 pt); diagonals x+y=2 (1 pt), 3 (2 pts), 4 (3 pts). Correct classification.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 4 is correct.\n\n8) Proposition 5 (No cover by three lines with exactly two sunny lines)\n- Quote: \"Suppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\"\n- Case 1: N has \u2264 2 points of P.\n  - By Lemma 3, each sunny line has \u2264 2 points of P. To cover all 6 points with three lines of capacity \u2264 2, each must cover exactly 2 disjoint points. Therefore N must be one of x=2, y=2, or x+y=3.\n  - For each of the three N, the remaining four points admit only one sunny pair (as verified explicitly), so they cannot be partitioned into two sunny pairs. Contradiction.\n- Case 2: N has \u2265 3 points of P.\n  - Then N is x=1, y=1, or x+y=4 (Lemma 4). In each case, the three remaining points Q have all pairwise lines non-sunny (checked explicitly), so each sunny line can cover at most one point of Q; two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points. Contradiction.\n- Conclusion: Such a cover cannot exist. Proposition 5 is correct.\n\n9) Proposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- t=0: x=1, y=1, x+y=4 cover P and are all non-sunny. Correct.\n- t=1: x=1, y=1, y=x cover P; only y=x is sunny. Correct.\n- t=3: The three sunny lines from Lemma 3 cover P. Correct.\n- Conclusion: The possible numbers of sunny lines in a three-line cover of S_3 are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n10) Conclusion for general n\n- Quote: \"By Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3.

{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: \"The solution is correct,\" \"The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid,\" or \"The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps.\"\n    *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:\n        *   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.\n        *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).\n\n*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**\n    Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.\n\n**Example of the Required Summary Format**\n*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get...\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.\n*   **Location:** \"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A-C > B-D$\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy. Subtracting inequalities in this manner is not a valid mathematical operation.\n\n\n\nUser: \n======================================================================\n### Problem ###\n\n*** Problem Statement ***\n\nA line in the plane is called *sunny* if it is not parallel to any of the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=0$.\n\nLet $n\\ge3$ be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

Coverage of last three columns explicitly checked; earlier columns by verticals. Correct.\n- k = 3: Lines x=1, \u2026, x=n\u22123 plus three sunny lines through pairs (n\u22122,1)-(n\u22121,2), (n\u22121,1)-(n\u22122,3), (n,1)-(n\u22122,2). Distinct, sunny, and cover the last three columns; earlier columns by verticals. Correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- The core logic (peeling down to three lines and classifying possibilities on S_3) is sound. The only issues found are minor misstatements of translation vectors in Lemma 2, which do not affect the validity of the argument because only the \u201cis a translate\u201d property is used later."

Correct.\n\n11) Constructions for general n\n- k = 0: Lines x=1, \u2026, x=n\u22122, y=1, x+y=n+1. All non-sunny; coverage verified for all columns a \u2264 n. Correct.\n- k = 1: Lines x=1, \u2026, x=n\u22123, x=n\u22122, y=1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3). Exactly one sunny (slope 1). Coverage of last three columns explicitly checked; earlier columns by verticals. Correct.\n- k = 3: Lines x=1, \u2026, x=n\u22123 plus three sunny lines through pairs (n\u22122,1)-(n\u22121,2), (n\u22121,1)-(n\u22122,3), (n,1)-(n\u22122,2). Distinct, sunny, and cover the last three columns; earlier columns by verticals. Correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- The core logic (peeling down to three lines and classifying possibilities on S_3) is sound. The only issues found are minor misstatements of translation vectors in Lemma 2, which do not affect the validity of the argument because only the \u201cis a translate\u201d property is used later."

    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: \"The solution is correct,\" \"The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid,\" or \"The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps.\"\n    *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:\n        *   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.\n        *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).\n\n*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**\n    Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.\n\n**Example of the Required Summary Format**\n*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get...\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.\n*   **Location:** \"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A-C > B-D$\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy. Subtracting inequalities in this manner is not a valid mathematical operation.\n\n\n\nUser: \n======================================================================\n### Problem ###\n\n*** Problem Statement ***\n\nA line in the plane is called *sunny* if it is not parallel to any of the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $x+y=0$.\n\nLet $n\\ge3$ be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader. Now, generate the **summary** and the **step-by-step verification log** for the solution above.

As above, the intended \u201ctranslate of S_{m\u22121}\u201d conclusion is still correct and sufficient.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Set-up and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: Correctly models the set of lattice points to be covered. The sunny/non-sunny classification matches the problem\u2019s statement (\u201cnot parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0\u201d).\n\n2) Lemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Quote: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\u201d\n- Key proof steps:\n  - \u201cThe three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n  - \u201cA line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore \u2026 the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4\u2026\u201d\n- Verification: \n  - Count of boundary lattice points 3m \u2212 3 is correct (each side has m lattice points; subtract the three vertices counted twice).\n  - For a convex polygon (triangle), any line not coincident with a side meets the boundary in at most two points; hence at most two boundary lattice points per such line.\n  - Since all boundary points lie in S_m, a cover of S_m must cover B_m. The inequality 2m < 3m \u2212 3 holds for m \u2265 4. The conclusion that at least one line equals a boundary side is valid.\n\n3) Lemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Quote: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\u201d\n- Key proof steps:\n  - Iteratively remove a boundary side line (guaranteed by Lemma 1) and all its points from the current set U (initially S_n). The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\n  - Subcases listed for U = S_m:\n    - \u201cRemoving y = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - \u201cRemoving x = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - \u201cRemoving x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\u201d\n  - Each removed line is non-sunny; repeat this until m = 3.\n- Verification:\n  - Correctness of the iterative structure: After removing one boundary side, the remaining lines still cover the remainder (since only points on the removed line are lost), and the remaining set is a translate of S_{m\u22121}. Lemma 1 applies at each stage while m \u2265 4.\n  - The three removal outcomes are right in substance (each yields a translate of S_{m\u22121}), but the specific translation vectors in the first two bullet points are sign-reversed:\n    - Removing y = 1 gives {(a, b): a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = translation of S_{m\u22121} by (0, +1), not (0, \u22121).\n    - Removing x = 1 gives {(a, b): a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = translation of S_{m\u22121} by (+1, 0), not (\u22121, 0).\n  - Issue classification: Justification Gap (misstated translation vectors). The conclusion \u201ctranslate of S_{m\u22121}\u201d is correct and sufficient for the induction. We proceed assuming the intended \u201cup to translation\u201d claim.\n  - The removed lines are indeed non-sunny (vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121). Thus at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, and three lines remain to cover a translate of S_3.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: True. This justifies analyzing the last three lines on S_3 itself without changing the count of sunny lines.\n\n5) Analysis of three-line covers of S_3: Lemma 3\n- Quote: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Exhaustive check on the six points shows that every other pair is either vertical, horizontal, or has slope \u22121. The three listed pairs have slopes 1, \u22121/2, \u22122 respectively, hence sunny. Each of those lines meets P in exactly those two points. The only collinear triples in P are the three boundary sides (non-sunny). Correct.\n\n6) Analysis of three-line covers of S_3: Lemma 4\n- Quote: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Verified by inspection of verticals x = c (c = 1 has 3 points; c = 2 has exactly two points (2,1),(2,2); c = 3 has one), horizontals y = c (analogous), and diagonals x + y = c (c = 4 has 3 points, c = 3 has exactly two, c = 2 has one). Correct.\n\n7) Proposition 5 (No cover of P by three lines with exactly two sunny)\n- Quote: \u201cSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\u201d\n  - Case 1: N contains at most two points of P. Then each line must cover exactly two points and the pairs partition P. Trying N \u2208 {x = 2, y = 2, x + y = 3} leads to a contradiction because among the remaining four points there is only one sunny pair.\n  - Case 2: N contains at least three points, so N is one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The remaining three points Q have all pairwise connections along non-sunny lines, so two sunny lines cannot cover all three points of Q.\n- Verification:\n  - Case 1: Each sunny line covers at most two points (by Lemma 3); with N \u2264 2 points, the only possibility to reach 6 is exactly two points per line with disjoint pairs. The enumerations in the three subcases are correct; each yields only one sunny pair among the remaining four points, so two sunny lines cannot partition those four points into two sunny pairs.\n  - Case 2: The sets Q are correct, and in each, every pair lies on a non-sunny line (vertical/horizontal/diagonal of slope \u22121). Thus two sunny lines cannot cover three points. The contradiction is valid.\n  - Conclusion of Proposition 5 is sound.\n\n8) Proposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Quote:\n  - t = 0: \u201cThe three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\u201d\n  - t = 1: \u201cThe lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\u201d\n  - t = 3: \u201cThe three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - t = 0: Clear cover; all three lines are non-sunny.\n  - t = 1: y = x is sunny and covers (1,1),(2,2); the two sides cover the rest. Exactly one sunny line.\n  - t = 3: The three lines through the three disjoint sunny pairs partition P and cover all six points; all are sunny. Correct.\n\n9) Conclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n- Verification: Follows directly from Lemma 2 and the classification for S_3.\n\n10) Constructions for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and all n \u2265 3\n- Quote:\n  - k = 0: \u201cx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n  - k = 1: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n  - k = 3: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and L_1: (n \u2212 2,1)-(n \u2212 1,2), L_2: (n \u2212 1,1)-(n \u2212 2,3), L_3: (n,1)-(n \u2212 2,2).\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Counts are n lines in each case and the lines are distinct. All non-sunny vs sunny classifications are correct. Coverage arguments for all columns a \u2264 n\u22123 (via verticals) and for the last three columns are correct in each case. Works also in edge case n = 3 (where the set of verticals is empty). Thus achievability is established.\n\nConclusion: Aside from the minor sign slips in the stated translation vectors in Lemma 2 (which do not affect the logical flow or conclusions), the solution is rigorous and complete."

"Summary\n\nFinal Verdict: The solution is correct.\n\nList of Findings:\n- Location: \u201cRemoving y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2013 The stated translation vector is incorrect; the correct translation is by (0, +1). The intended conclusion (\u201cit is a translate of S_{m\u22121}\u201d) remains valid and is sufficient for the argument.\n- Location: \u201cRemoving x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2013 The stated translation vector is incorrect; the correct translation is by (+1, 0). As above, the intended \u201ctranslate of S_{m\u22121}\u201d conclusion is still correct and sufficient.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\n1) Set-up and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: Correctly models the set of lattice points to be covered. The sunny/non-sunny classification matches the problem\u2019s statement (\u201cnot parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0\u201d).\n\n2) Lemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Quote: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\u201d\n- Key proof steps:\n  - \u201cThe three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n  - \u201cA line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore \u2026 the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4\u2026\u201d\n- Verification: \n  - Count of boundary lattice points 3m \u2212 3 is correct (each side has m lattice points; subtract the three vertices counted twice).\n  - For a convex polygon (triangle), any line not coincident with a side meets the boundary in at most two points; hence at most two boundary lattice points per such line.\n  - Since all boundary points lie in S_m, a cover of S_m must cover B_m. The inequality 2m < 3m \u2212 3 holds for m \u2265 4. The conclusion that at least one line equals a boundary side is valid.\n\n3) Lemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Quote: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\u201d\n- Key proof steps:\n  - Iteratively remove a boundary side line (guaranteed by Lemma 1) and all its points from the current set U (initially S_n). The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}.\n  - Subcases listed for U = S_m:\n    - \u201cRemoving y = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - \u201cRemoving x = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\u201d\n    - \u201cRemoving x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\u201d\n  - Each removed line is non-sunny; repeat this until m = 3.\n- Verification:\n  - Correctness of the iterative structure: After removing one boundary side, the remaining lines still cover the remainder (since only points on the removed line are lost), and the remaining set is a translate of S_{m\u22121}. Lemma 1 applies at each stage while m \u2265 4.\n  - The three removal outcomes are right in substance (each yields a translate of S_{m\u22121}), but the specific translation vectors in the first two bullet points are sign-reversed:\n    - Removing y = 1 gives {(a, b): a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = translation of S_{m\u22121} by (0, +1), not (0, \u22121).\n    - Removing x = 1 gives {(a, b): a \u2265 2, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 m + 1} = translation of S_{m\u22121} by (+1, 0), not (\u22121, 0).\n  - Issue classification: Justification Gap (misstated translation vectors). The conclusion \u201ctranslate of S_{m\u22121}\u201d is correct and sufficient for the induction. We proceed assuming the intended \u201cup to translation\u201d claim.\n  - The removed lines are indeed non-sunny (vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121). Thus at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny, and three lines remain to cover a translate of S_3.\n\n4) Remark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n- Verification: True. This justifies analyzing the last three lines on S_3 itself without changing the count of sunny lines.\n\n5) Analysis of three-line covers of S_3: Lemma 3\n- Quote: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Exhaustive check on the six points shows that every other pair is either vertical, horizontal, or has slope \u22121. The three listed pairs have slopes 1, \u22121/2, \u22122 respectively, hence sunny. Each of those lines meets P in exactly those two points. The only collinear triples in P are the three boundary sides (non-sunny). Correct.\n\n6) Analysis of three-line covers of S_3: Lemma 4\n- Quote: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Verified by inspection of verticals x = c (c = 1 has 3 points; c = 2 has exactly two points (2,1),(2,2); c = 3 has one), horizontals y = c (analogous), and diagonals x + y = c (c = 4 has 3 points, c = 3 has exactly two, c = 2 has one). Correct.\n\n7) Proposition 5 (No cover of P by three lines with exactly two sunny)\n- Quote: \u201cSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\u201d\n  - Case 1: N contains at most two points of P. Then each line must cover exactly two points and the pairs partition P. Trying N \u2208 {x = 2, y = 2, x + y = 3} leads to a contradiction because among the remaining four points there is only one sunny pair.\n  - Case 2: N contains at least three points, so N is one of x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The remaining three points Q have all pairwise connections along non-sunny lines, so two sunny lines cannot cover all three points of Q.\n- Verification:\n  - Case 1: Each sunny line covers at most two points (by Lemma 3); with N \u2264 2 points, the only possibility to reach 6 is exactly two points per line with disjoint pairs. The enumerations in the three subcases are correct; each yields only one sunny pair among the remaining four points, so two sunny lines cannot partition those four points into two sunny pairs.\n  - Case 2: The sets Q are correct, and in each, every pair lies on a non-sunny line (vertical/horizontal/diagonal of slope \u22121). Thus two sunny lines cannot cover three points. The contradiction is valid.\n  - Conclusion of Proposition 5 is sound.\n\n8) Proposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Quote:\n  - t = 0: \u201cThe three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\u201d\n  - t = 1: \u201cThe lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\u201d\n  - t = 3: \u201cThe three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - t = 0: Clear cover; all three lines are non-sunny.\n  - t = 1: y = x is sunny and covers (1,1),(2,2); the two sides cover the rest. Exactly one sunny line.\n  - t = 3: The three lines through the three disjoint sunny pairs partition P and cover all six points; all are sunny. Correct.\n\n9) Conclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n- Verification: Follows directly from Lemma 2 and the classification for S_3.\n\n10) Constructions for each k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and all n \u2265 3\n- Quote:\n  - k = 0: \u201cx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n  - k = 1: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n  - k = 3: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and L_1: (n \u2212 2,1)-(n \u2212 1,2), L_2: (n \u2212 1,1)-(n \u2212 2,3), L_3: (n,1)-(n \u2212 2,2).\u201d\n- Verification:\n  - Counts are n lines in each case and the lines are distinct.

    "input": "System: \nYou are an expert mathematician and a meticulous grader for an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level exam. Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct **only if every step is rigorously justified.** A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Instructions ###\n\n**1. Core Instructions**\n*   Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**\n*   You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.\n\n**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**\nWhen you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.\n\n*   **a. Critical Error:**\n    This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that `A>B, C>D` implies `A-C>B-D`) and **factual errors** (e.g., a calculation error like `2+3=6`).\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.\n        *   Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.\n        *   You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.\n\n*   **b. Justification Gap:**\n    This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        *   Explain the gap in the justification.\n        *   State that you will **assume the step's conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.\n        *   Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.\n\n**3. Output Format**\nYour response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.\n\n*   **a. Summary**\n    This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:\n    *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution.

Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ distinct lines in the plane satisfying both the following:\n*   for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a+b\\le n+1$, the point $(a,b)$ is on at least one of the lines; and\n*   exactly $k$ of the lines are sunny.\n\n======================================================================\n### Solution ###\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}.\n\n\n### Verification Task Reminder ###\n\nYour task is to act as an IMO grader.

It is correct and later corroborated by Lemma 4, but here it lacks justification and is used to conclude that sunny lines contain at most two points of P.\n- Location: \u201cCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. \u2026 To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 The step omits explicit justification that N must in fact contain exactly two points (otherwise coverage is impossible) and that, together with the at-most-two bound for sunny lines, forces a disjoint partition into three 2-point sets. The logic is correct but not fully spelled out.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\nSetup and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct restatement of the region and \u201csunny\u201d definition (non-sunny exactly when parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0).\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Statement: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cThe three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. The two legs contain m lattice points each; the hypotenuse x+y=m+1 has m lattice points; subtract the three vertices that were double-counted to get 3m\u22123.\n  - Quote: \u201cA line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex).\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct standard fact: a line intersects the boundary of a convex polygon in at most two points unless it coincides with a side (excluded).\n  - Quote: \u201cTherefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. Each non-side line contributes at most two boundary points; the union is at most 2m points; for m\u22654, 2m < 3m\u22123. Since all boundary lattice points belong to S_m, they must be covered. Contradiction establishes the claim.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 1 is correct.\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Statement: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it.\u201d\n    - Verification: For the initial U=S_m with m\u22654, Lemma 1 applies and yields a boundary side among the covering lines. Removing it and its points is legitimate.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}\u2026 Removing y = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (0, \u22121) \u2026 Removing x = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (\u22121, 0) \u2026 Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. These are exactly the three possibilities and each results in a (translated) triangular lattice region S_{m\u22121}.\n  - Quote: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 This implicitly reapplies Lemma 1 to U which is now a translate of S_{m\u22121}, not S_{m\u22121} itself. Lemma 1 as stated is for S_m in its original position. While the boundary-count argument is translation-invariant (same number of boundary lattice points and convexity), this invariance is not explicitly stated here. For the sake of argument, we assume Lemma 1 holds for all translates as well.\n  - Quote: \u201cAfter exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny.\u201d\n    - Verification: Under the above assumption, each iteration removes a boundary side (non-sunny) and reduces m by 1 until m=3; hence at least n\u22123 lines removed are non-sunny. The remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. This part is correct.\n- Conclusion: The peeling argument is valid modulo the noted translation-invariance gap.\n\nRemark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct. Used later to translate the final 3-line configuration to S_3.\n\nThree-line analysis on S_3\n- Definition:\n  - Quote: \u201cP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct list of lattice points with a,b \u22651 and a+b \u2264 4.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cHorizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. There are 12 non-sunny pairs (vertical/horizontal/diagonal x+y=c) and 3 remaining sunny pairs exactly as listed.\n  - Quote: \u201cEach of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct; straightforward check of the three equations shows no third point of P lies on these lines.\n  - Quote: \u201cNo sunny line contains three points of P. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 The assertion that any 3-point collinearity in P must be a side is not proven here. It is true and is substantiated in Lemma 4, but within Lemma 3 this is stated without proof. For the sake of argument, we accept the conclusion \u201cno sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Conclusion: Identification of sunny pairs and the \u201cexactly two points per sunny line\u201d are correct; the \u201cno sunny line contains three points\u201d needs justification (which appears in Lemma 4).\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Proof:\n  - Quote: \u201cImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct by direct enumeration:\n      - Columns: x=1 has 3 points; x=2 has 2; x=3 has 1.\n      - Rows: y=1 has 3; y=2 has 2; y=3 has 1.\n      - Diagonals: x+y=4 has 3; x+y=3 has 2; x+y=2 has 1.\n    - This also confirms the claim used in Lemma 3 that any line with three points is one of the three sides (hence non-sunny).\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3)\n- Setup:\n  - Quote: \u201cSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: Clear setup.\n\n- Case 1:\n  - Quote: \u201cCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 It is implicit that if N contains \u22641 point, coverage is impossible since two sunny lines (each with at most two points) cover at most 4 points. Thus N must contain exactly two points, and each sunny line must also contain exactly two, with the three 2-point sets disjoint. The reasoning is correct but not explicitly articulated; we accept the conclusion for further checking.\n  - Subcases:\n    - Quote: \u201cIf N is x = 2 \u2026 the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\u201d\n      - Verification: Correct enumeration and use of Lemma 3. Similar verification holds for N=y=2 and N=x+y=3. Each subcase yields only one sunny pair among the remaining four points, so impossible to partition into two sunny pairs.\n\n- Case 2:\n  - Quote: \u201cCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N.\u2026 Thus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\u201d\n    - Verification: For each of the three possibilities, the remaining three points\u2019 pairwise lines are vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121, so no sunny line meets two of them. Two sunny lines can cover at most two points, leaving one uncovered. Contradiction is valid.\n- Conclusion: Proposition 5 is correct; Case 1 contains a minor omission as noted.\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Quote: \u201cThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\u201d\n  - t=0: x=1, y=1, x+y=4 cover P and are all non-sunny \u2014 correct.\n  - t=1: x=1, y=1, and y=x cover P; exactly y=x is sunny \u2014 correct.\n  - t=3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover all six points via three disjoint pairs \u2014 correct.\n\nConclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct given the peeling lemma and the invariance remark.\n\nConstructions for general n\n- k=0:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n    - Verification: n distinct non-sunny lines; they cover all points column-wise as described \u2014 correct.\n- k=1:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n    - Verification: Exactly one sunny line (slope 1). Coverage of the last three columns is correct. Distinctness holds \u2014 correct.\n- k=3:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and L_1 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), L_2 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), L_3 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2).\u201d\n    - Verification: Slopes 1, \u22122, \u22121/2 (all sunny). Coverage of the last three columns checked; lines are distinct \u2014 correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- The core logical structure is sound: the peeling argument reduces to S_3, S_3 is fully analyzed, and constructions exist for each k \u2208 {0,1,3}. The small gaps identified do not alter the correctness of the final conclusion but should be addressed for full rigor."

"Summary\n\nFinal Verdict: The solution\u2019s approach is viable and reaches the correct conclusion, but it contains several Justification Gaps.\n\nList of Findings:\n- Location: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 Lemma 1 is stated only for S_m in its original position; the iterative use implicitly applies Lemma 1 to translates of S_m without explicitly justifying that Lemma 1 holds under translation (it does, but should be stated).\n- Location: \u201cAny line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 This claim in Lemma 3 is asserted without proof at that point. It is correct and later corroborated by Lemma 4, but here it lacks justification and is used to conclude that sunny lines contain at most two points of P.\n- Location: \u201cCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. \u2026 To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n  - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 The step omits explicit justification that N must in fact contain exactly two points (otherwise coverage is impossible) and that, together with the at-most-two bound for sunny lines, forces a disjoint partition into three 2-point sets. The logic is correct but not fully spelled out.\n\nDetailed Verification Log\n\nSetup and definitions\n- Quote: \u201cLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct restatement of the region and \u201csunny\u201d definition (non-sunny exactly when parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0).\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma)\n- Statement: \u201cLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cThe three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. The two legs contain m lattice points each; the hypotenuse x+y=m+1 has m lattice points; subtract the three vertices that were double-counted to get 3m\u22123.\n  - Quote: \u201cA line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex).\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct standard fact: a line intersects the boundary of a convex polygon in at most two points unless it coincides with a side (excluded).\n  - Quote: \u201cTherefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. Each non-side line contributes at most two boundary points; the union is at most 2m points; for m\u22654, 2m < 3m\u22123. Since all boundary lattice points belong to S_m, they must be covered. Contradiction establishes the claim.\n- Conclusion: Lemma 1 is correct.\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling)\n- Statement: \u201cIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it.\u201d\n    - Verification: For the initial U=S_m with m\u22654, Lemma 1 applies and yields a boundary side among the covering lines. Removing it and its points is legitimate.\n  - Quote: \u201cThe uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}\u2026 Removing y = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (0, \u22121) \u2026 Removing x = 1 yields \u2026 translate by (\u22121, 0) \u2026 Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. These are exactly the three possibilities and each results in a (translated) triangular lattice region S_{m\u22121}.\n  - Quote: \u201cReplace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 This implicitly reapplies Lemma 1 to U which is now a translate of S_{m\u22121}, not S_{m\u22121} itself. Lemma 1 as stated is for S_m in its original position. While the boundary-count argument is translation-invariant (same number of boundary lattice points and convexity), this invariance is not explicitly stated here. For the sake of argument, we assume Lemma 1 holds for all translates as well.\n  - Quote: \u201cAfter exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny.\u201d\n    - Verification: Under the above assumption, each iteration removes a boundary side (non-sunny) and reduces m by 1 until m=3; hence at least n\u22123 lines removed are non-sunny. The remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. This part is correct.\n- Conclusion: The peeling argument is valid modulo the noted translation-invariance gap.\n\nRemark on invariance\n- Quote: \u201cTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct. Used later to translate the final 3-line configuration to S_3.\n\nThree-line analysis on S_3\n- Definition:\n  - Quote: \u201cP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct list of lattice points with a,b \u22651 and a+b \u2264 4.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}. Each of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Proof steps:\n  - Quote: \u201cHorizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct. There are 12 non-sunny pairs (vertical/horizontal/diagonal x+y=c) and 3 remaining sunny pairs exactly as listed.\n  - Quote: \u201cEach of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct; straightforward check of the three equations shows no third point of P lies on these lines.\n  - Quote: \u201cNo sunny line contains three points of P. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 The assertion that any 3-point collinearity in P must be a side is not proven here. It is true and is substantiated in Lemma 4, but within Lemma 3 this is stated without proof. For the sake of argument, we accept the conclusion \u201cno sunny line contains three points of P.\u201d\n- Conclusion: Identification of sunny pairs and the \u201cexactly two points per sunny line\u201d are correct; the \u201cno sunny line contains three points\u201d needs justification (which appears in Lemma 4).\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P)\n- Statement: \u201cA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\u201d\n- Proof:\n  - Quote: \u201cImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}.\u201d\n    - Verification: Correct by direct enumeration:\n      - Columns: x=1 has 3 points; x=2 has 2; x=3 has 1.\n      - Rows: y=1 has 3; y=2 has 2; y=3 has 1.\n      - Diagonals: x+y=4 has 3; x+y=3 has 2; x+y=2 has 1.\n    - This also confirms the claim used in Lemma 3 that any line with three points is one of the three sides (hence non-sunny).\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3)\n- Setup:\n  - Quote: \u201cSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\u201d\n    - Verification: Clear setup.\n\n- Case 1:\n  - Quote: \u201cCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P.\u201d\n    - Issue: Justification Gap \u2014 It is implicit that if N contains \u22641 point, coverage is impossible since two sunny lines (each with at most two points) cover at most 4 points. Thus N must contain exactly two points, and each sunny line must also contain exactly two, with the three 2-point sets disjoint. The reasoning is correct but not explicitly articulated; we accept the conclusion for further checking.\n  - Subcases:\n    - Quote: \u201cIf N is x = 2 \u2026 the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\u201d\n      - Verification: Correct enumeration and use of Lemma 3. Similar verification holds for N=y=2 and N=x+y=3. Each subcase yields only one sunny pair among the remaining four points, so impossible to partition into two sunny pairs.\n\n- Case 2:\n  - Quote: \u201cCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N.\u2026 Thus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\u201d\n    - Verification: For each of the three possibilities, the remaining three points\u2019 pairwise lines are vertical, horizontal, or slope \u22121, so no sunny line meets two of them. Two sunny lines can cover at most two points, leaving one uncovered. Contradiction is valid.\n- Conclusion: Proposition 5 is correct; Case 1 contains a minor omission as noted.\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3)\n- Quote: \u201cThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\u201d\n  - t=0: x=1, y=1, x+y=4 cover P and are all non-sunny \u2014 correct.\n  - t=1: x=1, y=1, and y=x cover P; exactly y=x is sunny \u2014 correct.\n  - t=3: the three sunny lines through the pairs of Lemma 3 cover all six points via three disjoint pairs \u2014 correct.\n\nConclusion for general n\n- Quote: \u201cBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\u201d\n  - Verification: Correct given the peeling lemma and the invariance remark.\n\nConstructions for general n\n- k=0:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\u201d\n    - Verification: n distinct non-sunny lines; they cover all points column-wise as described \u2014 correct.\n- k=1:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\u201d\n    - Verification: Exactly one sunny line (slope 1). Coverage of the last three columns is correct. Distinctness holds \u2014 correct.\n- k=3:\n  - Quote: \u201cx = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and L_1 through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2), L_2 through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3), L_3 through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2).\u201d\n    - Verification: Slopes 1, \u22122, \u22121/2 (all sunny). Coverage of the last three columns checked; lines are distinct \u2014 correct.\n\nOverall assessment\n- The core logical structure is sound: the peeling argument reduces to S_3, S_3 is fully analyzed, and constructions exist for each k \u2208 {0,1,3}. The small gaps identified do not alter the correctness of the final conclusion but should be addressed for full rigor."

"1. Summary\n\na. Verdict:\nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is: for every integer n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}; in particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny iff it is not parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or to x + y = 0 (i.e., not of slope 0, \u221e, or \u22121).\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of them is exactly a boundary side of the triangular lattice region, i.e., x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n- Peeling reduction: Iteratively remove such a boundary side (necessarily non-sunny) and the points it covers. The uncovered set is a translate of S_{m\u22121}. After n \u2212 3 steps, three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Translations preserve parallelism, hence preserve the sunny/non-sunny status; thus the number of sunny lines among the last three equals the number of sunny lines in a three-line cover of S_3.\n- Classification on S_3:\n  \u2022 Let P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n  \u2022 The only sunny lines through two points of P are the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n    {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}; each contains exactly two points of P, and no sunny line contains three points of P.\n  \u2022 Any non-sunny line contains at most three points of P; those with three points are exactly the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4; those with exactly two points are x = 2, y = 2, x + y = 3.\n  \u2022 Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines: In any three-line cover with exactly two sunny lines, the remaining non-sunny line either has \u2264 2 points (which forces a partition of P into three pairs, but then the remaining four points cannot split into two sunny pairs), or \u2265 3 points (hence is a boundary side), but then the remaining three points are mutually non-sunny-paired, so two sunny lines cannot cover them. Hence t = 2 is impossible for S_3.\n  \u2022 Achievability for t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} is given by explicit configurations.\n- Lifting to S_n: By peeling, k \u2264 3. The number k equals the number of sunny lines among the final three covering a translate of S_3, hence k \u2208 {0,1,3}. Explicit constructions provide all three values for every n \u2265 3.\n\nKey lemmas/results:\n- Boundary lemma for S_m (m \u2265 4).\n- Peeling reduction (translation invariance of sunny/non-sunny).\n- S_3 classification: t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}."

"1. Summary\n\na. Verdict:\nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is: for every integer n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}; in particular, k = 2 is impossible.\n\nb. Method Sketch:\n- Let S_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }. A line is sunny iff it is not parallel to the x-axis, the y-axis, or to x + y = 0 (i.e., not of slope 0, \u221e, or \u22121).\n- Boundary lemma (precise): For m \u2265 4, if m distinct lines cover S_m, then one of them is exactly a boundary side of the triangular lattice region, i.e., x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n- Peeling reduction: Iteratively remove such a boundary side (necessarily non-sunny) and the points it covers. The uncovered set is a translate of S_{m\u22121}. After n \u2212 3 steps, three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Translations preserve parallelism, hence preserve the sunny/non-sunny status; thus the number of sunny lines among the last three equals the number of sunny lines in a three-line cover of S_3.\n- Classification on S_3:\n  \u2022 Let P := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n  \u2022 The only sunny lines through two points of P are the three lines through the disjoint pairs\n    {(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}; each contains exactly two points of P, and no sunny line contains three points of P.\n  \u2022 Any non-sunny line contains at most three points of P; those with three points are exactly the three boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4; those with exactly two points are x = 2, y = 2, x + y = 3.\n  \u2022 Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines: In any three-line cover with exactly two sunny lines, the remaining non-sunny line either has \u2264 2 points (which forces a partition of P into three pairs, but then the remaining four points cannot split into two sunny pairs), or \u2265 3 points (hence is a boundary side), but then the remaining three points are mutually non-sunny-paired, so two sunny lines cannot cover them. Hence t = 2 is impossible for S_3.\n  \u2022 Achievability for t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} is given by explicit configurations.\n- Lifting to S_n: By peeling, k \u2264 3. The number k equals the number of sunny lines among the final three covering a translate of S_3, hence k \u2208 {0,1,3}. Explicit constructions provide all three values for every n \u2265 3.\n\nKey lemmas/results:\n- Boundary lemma for S_m (m \u2265 4).\n- Peeling reduction (translation invariance of sunny/non-sunny).\n- S_3 classification: t \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and t \u2260 2.\n\n2. Detailed Solution\n\nLet n \u2265 3 be fixed and define\nS_n := { (a, b) \u2208 \u2124^2 : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 1, a + b \u2264 n + 1 }.\nA line is called non-sunny if it is horizontal, vertical, or of slope \u22121; otherwise it is sunny.\n\nLemma 1 (Boundary lemma).\nLet m \u2265 4. Suppose m distinct lines L_1, \u2026, L_m cover S_m. Then one of the L_i is exactly one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = m + 1.\n\nProof.\nLet B_m be the set of lattice points on the boundary of the (closed) lattice triangle with vertices (1,1), (1,m), (m,1). The three sides contain m, m, and m lattice points, and the three vertices are double-counted, so |B_m| = 3m \u2212 3. A line that is not equal to any side of this triangle intersects its boundary in at most two points (the triangle is convex). Therefore, if none of the L_i is a side, then together the L_i can cover at most 2m boundary lattice points, which is < 3m \u2212 3 for m \u2265 4, a contradiction. Hence at least one L_i is a boundary side. \u220e\n\nLemma 2 (Peeling).\nIn any cover of S_n by n distinct lines, at least n \u2212 3 of the lines are non-sunny. Moreover, after removing n \u2212 3 boundary sides (all non-sunny) as provided by Lemma 1 iteratively while the current size m \u2265 4, the remaining three lines from the original family cover a set that is a translate of S_3.\n\nProof.\nInitialize m := n and U := S_m. By Lemma 1, since m \u2265 4, among the covering lines there is a boundary side of U; remove this line and all points of U on it. The uncovered set is, up to translation, S_{m\u22121}. Indeed:\n- Removing y = 1 yields {(a, b) : a \u2265 1, b \u2265 2, a + b \u2264 m + 1}, which is the translate by (0, \u22121) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x = 1 yields the translate by (\u22121, 0) of S_{m\u22121}.\n- Removing x + y = m + 1 yields S_{m\u22121} itself.\nIn all cases the removed line is non-sunny. Replace m by m \u2212 1 and U by the uncovered set, and repeat while m \u2265 4. After exactly n \u2212 3 iterations we obtain m = 3 and three of the original lines remain and cover a translate of S_3. Therefore at least n \u2212 3 of the original lines are non-sunny. \u220e\n\nRemark on invariance.\nTranslations preserve parallelism and slopes, hence preserve the property of being sunny or non-sunny. Thus, in analyzing the last three lines covering a translate of S_3, we may translate the entire configuration so that the uncovered set is exactly S_3 without affecting the number of sunny lines.\n\nWe now analyze three-line covers of S_3. Let\nP := S_3 = { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) }.\n\nLemma 3 (Two-point sunny lines through P).\nAmong all pairs of distinct points in P, the only pairs that determine a sunny line are the three disjoint pairs\n{(1,1),(2,2)}, {(1,2),(3,1)}, {(1,3),(2,1)}.\nEach of these lines contains exactly the two indicated points of P. No sunny line contains three points of P.\n\nProof.\nCompute slopes for all pairs in P. Horizontal pairs (slope 0), vertical pairs (slope \u221e), and pairs on lines x + y = c (slope \u22121) are non-sunny. A direct check shows the only remaining pair slopes are 1 for (1,1)-(2,2), \u22121/2 for (1,2)-(3,1), and \u22122 for (1,3)-(2,1), which are sunny. Each of these three lines misses the other three points of P, so each contains exactly two points. Any line through three points of P must be one of the three sides of the triangle, hence non-sunny. \u220e\n\nLemma 4 (Non-sunny lines through P).\nA non-sunny line contains at most three points of P. Those with three points are exactly the boundary sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4. The only non-sunny lines with exactly two points of P are x = 2, y = 2, and x + y = 3.\n\nProof.\nImmediate by inspection of columns x = 1,2,3, rows y = 1,2,3, and diagonals x + y = c with c \u2208 {2,3,4}. \u220e\n\nProposition 5 (Impossibility of exactly two sunny lines on S_3).\nThere is no cover of P by three distinct lines with exactly two sunny lines.\n\nProof.\nSuppose three lines S_1, S_2 (sunny) and N (non-sunny) cover P.\n\nCase 1: N contains at most two points of P. By Lemma 3, each sunny line contains at most two points of P. To cover six points with three lines, we must have that each line contains exactly two points of P, and these three two-point sets form a partition of P. Then N is one of the non-sunny two-point lines listed in Lemma 4.\n- If N is x = 2 with points {(2,1),(2,2)}, then the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(3,1)}. By Lemma 3, among these four points the only sunny pair is {(1,2),(3,1)}. Hence two sunny lines cannot partition these four points into two sunny pairs, a contradiction.\n- If N is y = 2 with points {(1,2),(2,2)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,3),(2,1)}. Again impossible.\n- If N is x + y = 3 with points {(1,2),(2,1)}, the remaining four points are {(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)}. Among these, the only sunny pair is {(1,1),(2,2)}. Again impossible.\n\nCase 2: N contains at least three points of P. By Lemma 4, N is one of the three sides x = 1, y = 1, or x + y = 4. Consider the three remaining points Q := P \\ N. In each of the three possibilities, Q consists of three points such that any pair among them lies on a non-sunny line:\n- If N is x = 1, then Q = {(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is y = 1, then Q = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,2)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\n- If N is x + y = 4, then Q = {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}; pairs are vertical, horizontal, and slope \u22121.\nThus no sunny line contains two points of Q. Two sunny lines can cover at most two of the three points in Q, contradiction.\n\nIn all cases we obtain a contradiction. Hence such a cover does not exist. \u220e\n\nProposition 6 (Achievability on S_3).\nThere exist covers of P by three lines with exactly t sunny lines for each t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n- t = 0: The three sides x = 1, y = 1, x + y = 4.\n- t = 1: The lines x = 1, y = 1, and y = x.\n- t = 3: The three sunny lines through the pairs in Lemma 3.\n\nCombining Propositions 5 and 6, the possible numbers of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3 are exactly t \u2208 {0, 1, 3}.\n\nConclusion for general n.\nBy Lemma 2, in any cover of S_n by n lines, at least n \u2212 3 lines are non-sunny and the remaining three lines cover a translate of S_3. By translation invariance, the number k of sunny lines among the original n lines equals the number t of sunny lines among three lines covering S_3, hence k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} and k \u2260 2.\n\nFinally, we construct configurations achieving k \u2208 {0, 1, 3} for each n \u2265 3.\n\n- k = 0: Take the n lines\n  x = 1, x = 2, \u2026, x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, x + y = n + 1.\n  These are n distinct non-sunny lines. The verticals cover all points with a \u2264 n \u2212 2; the two sides cover the remaining columns a = n \u2212 1 and a = n.\n\n- k = 1: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three lines\n  x = n \u2212 2, y = 1, y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n  The last is sunny (slope 1), the others are non-sunny. The verticals cover columns a \u2264 n \u2212 3. The three remaining lines cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on x = n \u2212 2; (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n, 1) lie on y = 1; (n \u2212 1, 2) lies on y = x \u2212 (n \u2212 3).\n\n- k = 3: Take the n \u2212 3 verticals x = 1, \u2026, x = n \u2212 3 and the three sunny lines\n  L_1: through (n \u2212 2, 1) and (n \u2212 1, 2) (slope 1),\n  L_2: through (n \u2212 1, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 3) (slope \u22122),\n  L_3: through (n, 1) and (n \u2212 2, 2) (slope \u22121/2).\n  These cover the last three columns:\n  (n \u2212 2, b) for b = 1,2,3 lie on L_1, L_3, L_2 respectively; (n \u2212 1, 1) lies on L_2 and (n \u2212 1, 2) on L_1; (n, 1) lies on L_3.\n\nTherefore, for every n \u2265 3, the admissible values of k are exactly {0, 1, 3}."
